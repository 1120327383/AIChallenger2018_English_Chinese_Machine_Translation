that must have cleared your hiccups .
brother , i 'm gonna punch a hole . you follow me through .

i appreciate that , but it still doesn 't change a very tangled situation .
are we letting them take jack ?
he said if i wanted back on the blaze
i 'd like to know what the hell happened out there .
i had the same initial reaction .
like ... well , like we did back inn kansas .

mr. buchanan , it 's jack bauer on line one .
for a minute , he had me wondering if you were making this whole thing up .
i feel bummed out that i didn 't get the lead , and then i feel bummed out that i 'm the kind of person that gets bummed out that they didn 't get the lead , and then imagining being at that party tonight and having to pretend like i 'm not bummed out ...

we had plans . - plans for what ?
and he 'll come back to you , not as charles rainier , but as ...
but i can 't trust you anymore .
all he cares about is that behrooz is silenced .
oh , see now , that 's your first mistake .
either he finds the people responsible for planning the override , or we 're looking at a nuclear holocaust .
but these are our children , debbie 's and mine and , mom , if you can 't accept that , we will move out from under your ro beep .
i think that whitney is the one that a man would want to have in his bedroom and anya would be the one you 'd buy the dress frferjts

if i were to do this , if i even could do it i 'd need a guarantee .
have you gotten anything from fayed ?
i 've been thinking , baby , maybe you were right .
he killed himself-we found him in the baggage room .
mo 'at ! no ! --if you are one of us help us
yes . as it turns out , your kidnappin was just a cover for a much larger attack . the terrorists used the broadcast of the trial to overload the internet , and diverted all of our attention away from what they were really trying to do .

trudy , fire up the ship ! go !
you sure we 're cleared for this ?

excuse me , pardon me , paula . - you disgusting little pig .

i-i just need to ... to see her .
i 'm so close to you , yet i-- sss !
you want to hide that we 're seeing each other . look , i want us to be you and me , but i think if we act like we 're just you and for a little while , it 'll make things easier with naomi , and that 'll give her time to hook up with some other guy and she 'll forget all about us .

so i formed a small group to locate and neutralize dubaku .
agent moss , the president 's here . go ahead .
that 's rachel. youngest of the three .
thousands of people are still lining up to register .
maybe she 's trying to kill us both . you ever think of that ?
it 's part of what they have to suffer for their art .
but the one thing i don 't want you to do is blame yourself .
tell me do the children miss me ?
hmm . could they hold a petulant catholic school girl
and no matter what i do , no matter how hopeless i am no matter how confused , that guilt is always there reminding me of the truth .
did ty do something to you ?
how many more accidents have to happen before you 're done getting back at your father ?
we 'll call you if we hear any news .
so my weekend was pretty awesome , too .
what is it , ethan , what 's wrong ?
jack , we have the president on the line .
you 're a guy . - yeah . yeah , um ...
but , uh , just ' cause we 're not going together doesn 't mean that we can 't dance together at the dance .
vanch will stay free to roam the streets .
and since your genome is identical to his , you could step into his shoes , so to speak .
i don 't care how you do it . i don 't care what it takes .
i 'm starving ! should we look at the menu ?
no , i just expected my dry cleaning , that 's all .

the thing is , she already did change .
we need to tell the kids about your birth son sooner than later , harry .
i stood by her for three years , and i brought her back .
you know what ? screw you , dixon !
there 's no better place to experience nature undisturbed by humans .
detective , - he 's on the phone . -- who ?
if necessary , we 'll fall back on visual confirmation , but since we 're talking,cubic miles ...
but if the whole matter 's gonna be treated as a joke ...
i 'm just gonna kill her , man ; this is bullshit !
that was our bust . that is our money .
i figure it 's like field-stripping a weapon . just repetition , repetition .
gonna have you on a shuttle tonight
maybe not . can you pull over and get this ?
and according to you , i can 't trust any of my law enforcement agencies .
yes , but i 'm waiting for her husband to die .

they got divorced about five years ago so it wasn 't like he had to hang out with me .
i 'll check it out . - alright .
i 'll pass with not receiving the trifle presents .
we lost track of each other and ...
what is going on with this show ?
it 's about listening to a photographer or director 's vision and delivering that message .
the americans have been playing us .
then you 'll be responsible for everything that happens .
i don 't know what you want ...
isn 't that the whole point of your little puppet show ?
mr. secretary , i can have a room prepared for yo to rest , if you like .
we 've just received a video feed confirming that another hostage has been executed inside the main terminal at ontario airport .
and , uh , oh yeah , this is going to be awesome right here .

she said that walter found it in their bedroom .
jack , i know what you 've done today , the sacrifice you 've made .
dixon , you 're , like , a million miles away right now . i don 't know ... i just thought you 'd be a little bit more excited to go out , since ...
you may tell her what to do .
can you explain that to me ? because i just don 't get it .
and this photo represents the girl that is a finalist .
apparently , gabe has overtaken the command room .

it 's a good thing you sealed off the canister , mr. bauer .

make sure your men don 't hit me when they come in .
watching a movie . some crap thing ...
you 're spying on her ? ! - just doing my due diligence , oliver .
and it doesn 't have to be me but then you have to show arthur what i just saw .
call me a dreamer , but i was kind of hoping she 'd get eaten by a lion .
you know , pre-show jitters , i think .
the tally 's seven to six in favor of invoking the 25th amendment and removing president palmer from power .
that 's some subconscious you 've got on you , cobb !

what ? -- what 's going on ? ! what are they doing ? !
see if you can get a hold of a hand radio .
i 'll need the entire transcripts of your communications with mr. bauer since he 's been inside .
or else i 'd be a chicken-flu-chicken

what is ctu waiting for ? ! -i don 't know .
the important thing is that we stick together .
so i 'm making the bottom level a hospital , so fischer will bring his father .
after a while , i just gave up and moved on .

they just cleared security . he 's on his way up .
not sure into what yet , but ...
corliss liked them a little more beefy .
i 'm not going to let some college counselor , who wears an ankle bracelet under her stockings , get in my way .

there was totally a sign there , and you blew right through it .
you know what , i wish we could put pictures of choking dolphins on the bottles .

i 'm just really hoping that this doesn 't affect us in any way .

got a towel for a fellow classmate ? - you go to cu ?
will you give me a lift to school ?
good luck , darling ! - break a leg !

how do i know you 're just not going to kill them anyway ?
i recently made the big move to nashville .
i miss , like , all the family things .
you don 't seem like you know it .

oh , hey . i was just asking .
yeah. they could fix me up , if i rotated back
what kind of a movie , eh ? kid ?
we didn 't end up leaving the motel room .
but after what happened there weren 't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill .
mr. matthews probably didn 't want to be hurt by what you said , but he was .
well , that 's ' cause she likes plants better than people .
no , no , i-i don 't , but if it hurts you this much to watch adrianna do this to herself , then what are you gonna do if you really lose her ?
doesn 't make sense . - i know .
i can 't take it anymore i can 't keep trying to save you when you won 't even try to save yourself .
you 're just afraid your chute won 't open and you 'll show up at your own funeral as a denver omelet .

i didn 't realize how serious it is . that 's not what 's going on here , and you know it .
you want to brownnose , kiddo , wash my car , okay ?

i thought it would be helpful to track a.r.g. u.s ' manhunt for floyd lawton aka deadshot , so i decrypted their communication logs .
everything would just be a lot easier if you stayed a girl .
the regiors truebred , candidate number one .
a time like this means a lot to me right now , because in the past , you know , i didn 't have very , very happy times .

a maze ? -- right , a maze .
no , yeah , it was so much fun .
what we have to do is we have to warn the british of what they 're facing .

and the reason the president is so confident is that he thinks his rescue attempt will save the day .

noh daegyu 's about to get elected !
if this is really it , i can turn off the override , and stop the remaining plants from melting down .
so , are you going to homecoming , teacher ?
you need to wake up , parker . --no . you need to wake up the wealth of this world isn 't in the ground . it 's all around us the na 'vi know that , and they are fighting to defend it
i-i 'll call you if i have any more questions .
really intimidating coming from the guy who just got out of a very cold pool .

and i bought two-- the blue calfskin , the brown crocodile .
do you know who else had access to it ?
couldn 't be any creepier than hanging out with my ex and his little girlfriend .
do you turn to these thoughts to comfort yourself in times of stress ?
