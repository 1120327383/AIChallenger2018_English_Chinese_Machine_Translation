<seg id="93">29	131	Is that your pet name for navid?</seg>
<seg id="94">20	351	Then tell me that Agent Moss followed up on Starkwood.</seg>
<seg id="95">17	320	The problem is Fayed will not rendezvous with his men until he speaks to that general, presumably to confirm the legitimacy of our undercover agents.</seg>
<seg id="96">4	193	You said that right. - Look here.</seg>

<seg id="101">35	95	Hey, speaking of moving, Dixon, I got to stop by my lawyer's office to sign some inheritance stuff before I hit the road.</seg>
<seg id="102">43	545	You mean in case you bring Mal in.</seg>
<seg id="103">43	162	True inspiration's impossible to fake. -- That's not true.</seg>
<seg id="104">4	433	So it's paved up to here, right?</seg>
<seg id="105">34	835	And if you don't understand that, well then, maybe you don't understand me.</seg>
<seg id="106">40	296	Brittany, I gotta say yes to you too,</seg>
<seg id="107">44	228	They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.</seg>
<seg id="108">19	635	We ordered them to hand Matobo over to us but no one's getting out of the vehicle.</seg>

<seg id="110">14	920	You're aware Mrs. Logan was found in one of the archive rooms?</seg>
<seg id="111">21	267	I know that this was about Adam.</seg>
<seg id="112">51	1043	I see you the aliens went back to their dying world</seg>
<seg id="113">52	171	If you look like them and you talk like them, then they'll start trusting us.</seg>

<seg id="117">51	870	I need to take some samples the Great Mother may choose to save all that she is in this body</seg>
<seg id="118">52	665	And then you can lecture me.</seg>
<seg id="119">38	20	Olivia's been gracing the charts worldwide for four decades.</seg>
<seg id="120">7	83	The deal was this far and no further.</seg>
<seg id="121">34	499	Well, actually, this is my house, so I can go wherever I want.</seg>
<seg id="122">21	537	Steve, your team is in danger. Get out of there right now!</seg>
<seg id="123">14	41	Can you make a visual, Curtis?</seg>
<seg id="124">10	625	What I needed for the concert was a drop-dead-gorgeous dress that made me look 25 and sophisticated enough to have a perfume named after me.</seg>

<seg id="126">14	687	Anything you do in here today will not stop that treaty from being signed.</seg>

<seg id="138">2	38	You better stop or your wife will leave you.</seg>
<seg id="139">35	106	Nice try, weirdo. - No, wait...</seg>

<seg id="150">49	463	You're going to rot in prison for life this time.</seg>
<seg id="151">44	407	He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds.</seg>
<seg id="152">53	312	And one night, Rex didn't come home when he was supposed to, and... and he wasn't answering his phone.</seg>
<seg id="153">54	425	She gets drunk, eats a bottle of her pills and jumps in the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="154">37	103	If that little freak can get in, anyone can. - You shouldn't call her that!</seg>
<seg id="155">39	481	Okay. How many times have you heard that version?</seg>
<seg id="156">3	471	We're both in the same boat. how's that for a metaphor?</seg>

<seg id="167">43	540	You know, I... Actually, I have a question about this layout.</seg>
<seg id="168">20	130	Okay. Dr. Macer, we've detected trace amounts of an airborne pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="169">17	201	Is this the complete dossier on general Habib? -No, sir.</seg>
<seg id="170">49	511	No, no, it doesn't matter, just as long as you're okay.</seg>
<seg id="171">17	137	Now, I can stop it, but tell me where the bombs are.</seg>

<seg id="207">14	1060	When Jack issued the command directive, he used the term "Flank two".</seg>
<seg id="208">14	453	Curtis, abort the countdown. Repeat, abort, abort.</seg>

<seg id="212">43	32	He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.</seg>
<seg id="213">40	63	I couldn't understand a word of it. - Goulash, it was goulash.</seg>
<seg id="214">19	39	Taylor killed Gedge, I don't know how.</seg>
<seg id="215">17	479	Doctor, what is happening to him?</seg>
<seg id="216">40	539	I’m Julie. Do you remember me at all?</seg>
<seg id="217">6	636	You never knew him, my brother Pius.</seg>
<seg id="218">45	826	What do you mean, a dream within a dream?</seg>
<seg id="219">42	450	I DID STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT WITH THE SILVER DRESS</seg>
<seg id="220">14	1087	He said 60 seconds three minutes ago.</seg>
<seg id="221">35	168	No one finds true love in high school.</seg>
<seg id="222">26	391	I was kind of hoping to start fresh with that new brother of ours.</seg>
<seg id="223">43	66	I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.</seg>
<seg id="224">31	211	Look, I made some suggestions for revision...</seg>
<seg id="225">54	262	Uh, he came over once with some papers Charlie had to sign.</seg>
<seg id="226">4	468	It's from the fall I took just a while ago.</seg>
<seg id="227">17	82	No, Karen, we can't afford to wait longer.</seg>
<seg id="228">25	640	Watching you, him, both of you dancing together.</seg>
<seg id="229">47	298	Well, I guess you guys must have met at the factory.</seg>
<seg id="230">22	77	You know, my grandma was up for the movie role, but she said that Elizabeth Taylor stole her part.</seg>
<seg id="231">19	484	For God's sake, Edward, tell them what they want to know!</seg>
<seg id="232">21	385	The video that your mother sent out...</seg>
<seg id="233">19	99	My chief concern is for Sangala, not myself.</seg>
<seg id="234">39	162	And to be honest, right now it seems far off.</seg>
<seg id="235">44	663	Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.</seg>
<seg id="236">37	340	I'm-I'm... I'm gonna get help. I'm calling 911.</seg>
<seg id="237">26	469	Do you want to go somewhere a little more private like upstairs?  Fine.</seg>
<seg id="238">33	483	I remember at the beginning of the year when we read this in Matthews' class, you went on and on about how much you liked it, and how amazing it was that Flaubert could write from a woman's perspective, and how much that inspired you. And I thought to myself, Whew, stay away from that girl. She's way too much.</seg>
<seg id="239">49	469	And even if he were to get by them, what's he going to do against the veritable army of sons of bitches I've got waiting for him?</seg>
<seg id="240">20	197	Agent Moss, you said there was an imminent threat.</seg>
<seg id="241">3	416	We were supposed to make a list of things we wanted to do in our lives before we... - kicked the bucket.</seg>
<seg id="242">52	1266	Hold position. -- Hold up, hold up.</seg>
<seg id="243">4	709	I didn't want to burden an old friend, with something like this.</seg>
<seg id="244">26	396	Sometimes, I just, you know, feel so alone.  Hey, you're not alone. You have me.</seg>
<seg id="245">3	420	I was gonna redo the list, but then...</seg>
<seg id="246">26	485	I don't like games, and I don't like people who play games.  This party's dead, let's bounce.  What happened to Annie?</seg>
<seg id="247">19	660	Kill Taylor, and have your men pack everything up.</seg>
<seg id="248">31	614	It's hard being in the same room as her.</seg>
<seg id="249">16	474	Captain, this is Jack Bauer. I want to assure you</seg>

<seg id="1224">30	564	Yeah, well, they also don't attack someone just because that person used to date their girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1225">48	224	I wasn't the only one who tracked it.</seg>
<seg id="1226">51	137	So you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man with no training of any kind, and see how it went?</seg>

<seg id="1259">20	461	We can catch 'em by surprise and lock down these weapons.</seg>
<seg id="1260">51	442	Thank you for flying Air Pandora</seg>

<seg id="1292">43	852	They just wanna ransom us. -- I heard them.</seg>
<seg id="1293">34	785	So, will you give me the marker?</seg>
<seg id="1294">11	522	I figured you'd want to hear the news first.</seg>
<seg id="1295">30	120	You're psychotic. - Liam, that's enough!</seg>
<seg id="1296">34	257	He's not much for studying, so he was double pissed.</seg>
<seg id="1297">52	898	They can upload and download data. Memories.</seg>

<seg id="1299">51	24	Remember, people, you lose that mask you're unconscious in 20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!</seg>
<seg id="1300">14	292	My people have just informed me that the assault has been delayed.</seg>
<seg id="1301">21	384	I never thought my mother would go this far.</seg>
<seg id="1302">41	329	I mean, we had four biological sons and then her and she's, of course, the idol to everybody in the family,</seg>
<seg id="1303">52	668	Trust me, I... learned the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="1304">43	598	It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.</seg>
<seg id="1305">52	124	Plus it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.</seg>
<seg id="1306">39	117	Oh, my god! - We have a deal.</seg>
<seg id="1307">21	3	As long as she lives, she'll never hear the name "Jack Bauer".</seg>
<seg id="1308">14	726	Between the summit and the hostage situation, he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.</seg>
<seg id="1309">10	679	You must see these Sidarthur people?</seg>
<seg id="1310">13	75	The environmental impact would also be catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="1311">14	59	The boy means something to you-- otherwise, you wouldn't have given yourself up so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1316">20	440	My God, we even passed a law so that they could build a military base 13 miles from the nation's capitol.</seg>
<seg id="1317">52	610	When? -- When you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="1318">42	533	AND YOU NEVER LET THE MAN OVERSHADOW YOU.</seg>
<seg id="1319">42	598	AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ANYA SHOWS SO THEY BOTH REPRESENT, "AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL" HAS NEVER HAD.</seg>
<seg id="1320">45	312	Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.</seg>
<seg id="1321">1	601	I am so proud of you -It's over.</seg>

<seg id="1328">21	60	Okay, copy that. I'll call you when I'm ready.</seg>
<seg id="1329">35	67	He could make any sound a great mix.</seg>
<seg id="1330">30	9	All I can think of is Liam.</seg>
<seg id="1331">24	690	Boy really knows how to celebrate, doesn't he?</seg>
<seg id="1332">29	447	We suddenly felt this huge earthquake and totally freaked out and got a bunch of pots and ran and hid under the kitchen table.</seg>
<seg id="1333">45	1086	We can still be together, right here in the world we built together.</seg>
<seg id="1334">29	570	You're gonna send me back to my mom. - No,no,no.</seg>
<seg id="1335">4	303	We shouldn't have mentioned it in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="1336">10	639	I can't say I'm sleeping over at your house when I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="1337">35	405	Maybe I should just stick this in the mailbox, make it easier for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="1338">24	346	You can't let that stop Annie from living.</seg>
<seg id="1339">11	146	He just wants me on his arm.</seg>
<seg id="1340">4	434	Yes. Till all the way down there.</seg>
<seg id="1341">31	606	But you did get one thing right, Jackie.</seg>
<seg id="1342">13	349	You tortured my son for almost three hours and ended up yielding nothing?</seg>
<seg id="1343">32	545	I'm not giving up, you know.</seg>
<seg id="1344">41	200	Let's see what you're going to do.</seg>

<seg id="1346">4	527	Here, take a sit. - All right.</seg>
<seg id="1347">20	285	We'd be looking at massive casualties on the Starkwood base, with no guarantee of destroying the bioweapons.</seg>
<seg id="1348">48	60	I don't know where the next Olympics are at, but you might want to think about signing yourself up.</seg>
<seg id="1349">2	225	lt reminds me of my mother's skirt. She left me, when l was boy.</seg>
<seg id="1350">38	144	My mother, Maria Lauren, was one of Dean Martin's golddiggers.</seg>
<seg id="1351">34	1282	My mom made me take like six this morning just in case I got hungry during the test, you know?</seg>
<seg id="1352">3	582	No, I couldn't think of anything I wanted to be stuck with permanently.</seg>
<seg id="1353">39	73	American idol, it's about giving people, you know, a second chance at their dreams.</seg>
<seg id="1354">53	244	They're not with me, I swear. Cooper! Tell me where my son is.</seg>
<seg id="1355">55	461	It's gonna take a little time.</seg>

<seg id="1357">40	131	Okay, now, this-- Firecrackers and fiesta string?</seg>
<seg id="1358">30	87	I gotta talk to you. - Don'T. Don'T.</seg>

<seg id="1360">34	1017	You know what? You're selfish, too. And...</seg>
<seg id="1361">30	154	Uh, but trust me, it's gonna be different this year.</seg>
<seg id="1362">51	142	That shouldn't be hard for you</seg>

<seg id="1367">43	653	COBB: Then I start to panic.</seg>
<seg id="1368">32	52	I was editing a report on a student art prodigy.</seg>

<seg id="1429">10	740	I would think that we could just have one decent rehearsal by now!</seg>
<seg id="1430">21	232	Not now, Mark. We're both operating from the same set of facts.</seg>
<seg id="1431">20	453	Madam President, we've been contacted by someone inside Stkwood.</seg>
<seg id="1432">37	216	You might as well just Krazy Glue a stick of butter to your ass.</seg>

<seg id="1636">34	1268	I forgave him for cheating, and in exchange he told me we could live anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1637">47	96	This is you getting to know the real me.</seg>
<seg id="1638">10	283	We're not English, and this isn't the 19th century, so I think we should adapt the classics to reflect our times.</seg>
<seg id="1639">21	498	The Americans should reach the other house in about five minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1640">54	648	Why not? -- Because it was mom's.</seg>
<seg id="1641">33	396	Come on. - No, I'm sorry.</seg>

<seg id="1651">43	696	I'm sorry. -- Oh, yeah, absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1652">41	252	The audience is here and so are piers and Sharon.</seg>
<seg id="1653">25	603	No, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me exactly what is gonna happen.</seg>

<seg id="1660">34	44	You don't think I'm gonna let you stay here with that bastard of a stepfather?</seg>
<seg id="1661">33	194	Fine, I'll talk to someone. Not Kelly.</seg>

<seg id="1665">33	43	The feud with Annie, the situation with Jen.</seg>
<seg id="1666">37	356	No way. - I got it on ebay. Authenticated.</seg>

<seg id="1672">6	149	I have something important to ask her.</seg>
<seg id="1673">14	334	Instead, everybody's waiting to hear what's going to happen at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="1674">31	459	I'm telling you, this thing was not only wilting, but it was actually starting to stink.</seg>
<seg id="1675">47	158	Mr. Diggle, I can't thank you enough for arranging to move my husband from County Ward to Starling General.</seg>
<seg id="1676">10	318	Now, each of you will be singing a song for me of your choice, and then you'll be reading a scene for me.</seg>

<seg id="3605">26	253	So, uh, when you gonna realize that you just have to have me.</seg>
<seg id="3606">13	45	They've got the videotapes on file, but unfortunately, they're working off a closed system.</seg>

<seg id="3644">42	140	OH, TAKE SIX, AREVA DARE CHI BLAST LASHES,</seg>
<seg id="3645">21	558	It doesn't justify any of this, Margot.</seg>

<seg id="3652">17	371	If you take your orders from general Habib as I do, how is it I've never heard of you or your cell?</seg>
<seg id="3653">53	334	I was hoping to talk to him face-to-face, but...</seg>
<seg id="3654">25	219	I take it you're probably going to go to homecoming with one of the other big posters.</seg>
<seg id="3655">34	637	I got the shaft in this deal.</seg>
<seg id="3656">38	319	I don't want to be perceived as a Taylor replicate.</seg>
<seg id="3657">37	443	Could you turn around? - No.</seg>
<seg id="3658">49	547	But with all this talk about threats, it can't be good.</seg>
<seg id="3659">45	110	Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.</seg>
<seg id="3660">29	386	Erevy moment is connected to a million other moments.</seg>
<seg id="3661">50	94	Well, you are in very capable hands.</seg>
<seg id="3662">43	417	So a closed loop like that will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.</seg>
<seg id="3663">43	773	You knew these risks and didn't tell us? -- There weren't meant to be risks.</seg>
<seg id="3664">25	202	I thought driving was your thing.</seg>
<seg id="3665">31	369	and as beautiful as you existed.</seg>
<seg id="3666">13	60	Then let me come to Felsted Security with you and make the I. D. there. It'll be quicker. - Audrey, I can't.</seg>
<seg id="3667">47	104	I think when someone at Walter's pay grade takes a business trip, it's always sudden, Thea. I wouldn't worry.</seg>
<seg id="3668">45	571	We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="3669">45	101	The second we get into that hotel approaching Fisher, his security's gonna be all over us.</seg>
<seg id="3670">24	444	Harry, tonight is a big night for Annie.</seg>

<seg id="3672">38	582	Um, I'm gonna ask you to get up.</seg>
<seg id="3673">6	188	And I don't... I don't...I don't work for me.</seg>
<seg id="3674">32	551	You were easily the most boring.</seg>
<seg id="3675">22	161	I've discussed it with Principal Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="3676">12	1053	telling them I'll receive the Committee tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id="3677">53	42	CHP just flagged him on a traffic camera heading south on the 405.</seg>
<seg id="3678">40	530	Outside the room, a brooding Richard Valez had his game face on.</seg>
<seg id="3679">4	466	At least he's not laying off. Do your best, pal.</seg>
<seg id="3680">10	362	Why had I been so certain I was going to get the lead?</seg>
<seg id="3681">45	1095	You take Fischer with you, all right?</seg>
<seg id="3682">4	93	They're all the same, take your pick.</seg>
<seg id="3683">39	553	And what would your friends say about you entering american  idol?</seg>
<seg id="3684">24	559	So, you think more about the party after?</seg>
<seg id="3685">10	187	It's your first day here, right?</seg>
<seg id="3686">27	277	You are my mother, she is my wife...</seg>
<seg id="3687">17	424	Yeah, well, the problem is, Sameer Al-Afted was killed two years ago in a raid by afghan forces.</seg>
<seg id="3688">40	217	I need someone to check in this cup.</seg>
<seg id="3689">24	243	Uh, yeah, it's just that not everybody's a ho-bot like you, Naomi.</seg>
<seg id="3690">45	978	Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this. Go for it.</seg>
<seg id="3691">40	66	Please, I’ve been singing since I was three years old.</seg>
<seg id="3692">13	569	Let me just check the headers.</seg>
<seg id="3693">49	427	The airfield was a very heavily fortified position.</seg>
<seg id="3694">7	162	Everything is always so neat with you, Monsieur Frank.</seg>
<seg id="3695">20	79	They know we have the weapons.</seg>
<seg id="3696">32	681	This actor kid Trevor. He's in one of Teddy's dad's movies.</seg>
<seg id="3697">12	830	I'm afraid it'll mean a lot of extra work for you putting things in order so I can get away.</seg>
<seg id="3698">43	65	What are you doing? It's too soon. -- But the dream's collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="3699">25	209	Uh, got to go find a new thing, so.</seg>
<seg id="3700">4	8	Oh, that. We've got elections approaching too.</seg>
<seg id="3701">13	143	Oh, I can do that for him.</seg>
<seg id="3702">52	458	She is Tsahik. The one who interprets the will of Eywa.</seg>
<seg id="3703">7	27	i don't want to get caught.</seg>
<seg id="3704">2	444	At least we should buy Makoli for the pallbearers.</seg>
<seg id="3705">22	673	Ryan let me back into his class.</seg>
<seg id="3706">40	335	I haven't sang in three years.</seg>

<seg id="3708">20	212	The infrastructure to develop and test biological weapons.</seg>
<seg id="3709">51	742	Well, well, well. I'd say diplomacy has failed</seg>
<seg id="3710">35	386	He would've been a lot more fun if he was naked.</seg>
<seg id="3711">21	474	Well, something about it just seems too easy.</seg>
<seg id="3712">33	236	Well, anyway, uh... we should go. Shall we?</seg>
<seg id="3713">15	193	By the time Jack gets close enough to be recognized, the TAC teams will move in.</seg>
<seg id="3714">42	296	AND IT'S NOT BEAUTIFUL TO SEE.</seg>
<seg id="3715">47	225	Where's Oliver? He's not out of town, too, is he?</seg>
<seg id="3716">39	382	Thank you, Ryan. - You're welcome.</seg>

<seg id="3718">40	485	Paula was right on the money.</seg>
<seg id="3719">53	131	Tell me... what did he say? He didn't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="3720">11	632	If my accountant testifies, all is lost</seg>
<seg id="3721">27	387	You guys told everyone adrianna's a druggie?</seg>
<seg id="3722">43	559	The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.</seg>
<seg id="3723">41	225	It made me laugh and it made me go wow.</seg>
<seg id="3724">16	584	I don't have the authority to keep that plane from landing.</seg>
<seg id="3725">48	339	Tommy, you working for me, that could be fun.</seg>
<seg id="3726">48	418	Tell your mistress Frank Bertinelli sends his regards.</seg>
<seg id="3727">43	764	Which, in our case, is just you.</seg>
<seg id="3728">16	127	Okay, put everything you've got from that flight under the shared volume so I can get to it.</seg>
<seg id="3729">38	443	I was born by the river in a little tent oh, and just like the river I've been running ever since it's been a long a long time coming Hmm.</seg>
<seg id="3730">6	288	I stand vigil for her beside the lighthouse.</seg>
<seg id="3731">21	256	Come on. Captain Cordero with the embassy marine detachment, he filed a complaint about your actions during the standoff.</seg>
<seg id="3732">47	183	Yeah, but even with photo enhancement, you're gonna have a problem getting a clear shot of that ring.</seg>
<seg id="3733">14	26	We've got six hostiles  wearing explosive vests.</seg>
<seg id="3734">5	409	We will do a business report for you</seg>
<seg id="3735">15	289	The deal I made with Erwich was to sell him the chip, not to get my face all over the news.</seg>
<seg id="3736">29	342	After everything I've been through with my mother, here I am just like her!</seg>
<seg id="3737">41	450	I'm going to do a song that's called "the phil.</seg>
<seg id="3738">35	191	I think what he's trying to say is that the, uh, the house has been sold.</seg>
<seg id="3739">45	13	That she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home we had to kill ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="3740">52	804	But this woman must also choose me.</seg>
<seg id="3741">5	397	Live your own constructive and meaningful life</seg>

<seg id="3787">51	758	Mo'at! No! --If you are one of us help us</seg>
<seg id="3788">13	51	Yes. As it turns out, your kidnappin was just a cover for a much larger attack. The terrorists used the broadcast of the trial to overload the Internet, and diverted all of our attention away from what they were really trying to do.</seg>
<seg id="3789">30	595	does this lock? - Oh, yeah.</seg>
<seg id="3790">51	798	Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!</seg>
<seg id="3791">3	608	You sure we're cleared for this?</seg>

<seg id="3801">21	241	I know, in some ways, you-you were still trying to protect me.</seg>
<seg id="3802">11	530	Which brings me to my point. Tessio-san...</seg>
<seg id="3803">5	605	Misty eyes are never meant to see clearly...</seg>
<seg id="3804">35	572	Dear Naomi, I know you don't want to talk to me, "But I hate that I hurt you.</seg>

<seg id="3809">24	112	"Invited dress"-- what does that mean?</seg>
<seg id="3810">7	448	But, uh, you wouldn't know anything about that?</seg>

<seg id="3818">26	102	I'm so close to you, yet I-- sss!</seg>
<seg id="3819">26	94	You want to hide that we're seeing each other.  Look, I want us to be you and me, but I think if we act like we're just you and for a little while, it'll make things easier with Naomi, and that'll give her time to hook up with some other guy and she'll forget all about us.</seg>
<seg id="3820">34	1284	Look, Dixon, I just gotta say it kinda feels like you were blowing me off last night.</seg>
<seg id="3821">4	513	A more realistic, approachable, plans that can unfold right now. Is that so hard to think of?</seg>
<seg id="3822">14	58	Mr. Bauer, what is CTU's assault plan?</seg>
<seg id="3823">14	872	I'll have Chloe send it to your laptop.</seg>
<seg id="3824">37	152	How many rooms in this house?</seg>
<seg id="3825">29	414	I just, I love them more.</seg>
<seg id="3826">38	21	Her number one hits include the xanadu anthem, magic.</seg>
<seg id="3827">41	325	My mom and dad adopted me from china when I was about 6 months old and I came to America,</seg>
<seg id="3828">20	30	Jack, I can't assault a private compound unless I have proof that a weapon exists.</seg>
<seg id="3829">43	543	In case one of us brings in our projections.</seg>
<seg id="3830">20	55	Raise your arms and close your eyes.</seg>
<seg id="3831">48	171	People who need to be reminded that Starling City isn't theirs for the taking.</seg>
<seg id="3832">26	127	No, it'll be fun, and I would love to get a from it all</seg>
<seg id="3833">16	6	This entire day has been one giant lie!</seg>
<seg id="3834">40	471	I thought it was all a bit of an effort.</seg>
<seg id="3835">19	125	So I formed a small group to locate and neutralize Dubaku.</seg>
<seg id="3836">20	452	Agent Moss, the president's here. Go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="3837">3	281	That's Rachel. youngest of the three.</seg>
<seg id="3838">38	427	Thousands of people are still lining up to register.</seg>
<seg id="3839">3	314	Maybe she's trying to kill us both. You ever think of that?</seg>
<seg id="3840">10	215	It's part of what they have to suffer for their art.</seg>
<seg id="3841">21	85	But the one thing I don't want you to do is blame yourself.</seg>
<seg id="3842">44	51	Tell me do the children miss me?</seg>
<seg id="3843">32	120	Hmm. Could they hold A petulant catholic school girl</seg>
<seg id="3844">45	1056	And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am no matter how confused, that guilt is always there reminding me of the truth.</seg>
<seg id="3845">24	700	Did Ty do something to you?</seg>
<seg id="3846">48	52	How many more accidents have to happen before you're done getting back at your father?</seg>
<seg id="3847">33	96	we'll call you if we hear any news.</seg>
<seg id="3848">31	25	So my weekend was pretty awesome, too.</seg>
<seg id="3849">20	6	What is it, Ethan, what's wrong?</seg>
<seg id="3850">15	324	Jack, we have the president on the line.</seg>
<seg id="3851">35	104	You're a guy. - Yeah. Yeah, um...</seg>
<seg id="3852">25	106	But, uh, just 'cause we're not going together doesn't mean that we can't dance together at the dance.</seg>
<seg id="3853">49	100	Vanch will stay free to roam the streets.</seg>
<seg id="3854">52	35	And since your genome is identical to his, you could step into his shoes, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="3855">14	8	I don't care how you do it. I don't care what it takes.</seg>
<seg id="3856">31	463	I'm starving! Should we look at the menu?</seg>
<seg id="3857">34	88	No, I just expected my dry cleaning, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="3858">25	505	Are you saying you would like to dance with me?</seg>
<seg id="3859">52	578	There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of, way up in the mountains.</seg>
<seg id="3860">20	65	Hang on one second. I need you to put together a briefing packet on Starkwood.</seg>
<seg id="3861">18	376	Now they are going to pay a very steep price for interfering in our affairs</seg>
<seg id="3862">48	64	Nick Salvati, Frank Bertinelli's right hand, was found with his neck snapped along with a few of his thugs.</seg>
<seg id="3863">51	530	Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments there is something really interesting going on in there biologically</seg>
<seg id="3864">43	149	He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.</seg>
<seg id="3865">48	402	The thing is, she already did change.</seg>
<seg id="3866">25	588	We need to tell the kids about your birth son sooner than later, Harry.</seg>
<seg id="3867">21	2	I stood by her for three years, and I brought her back.</seg>
<seg id="3868">30	15	You know what? Screw you, dixon!</seg>
<seg id="3869">4	696	There's no better place to experience nature undisturbed by humans.</seg>
<seg id="3870">55	113	Detective, - he's on the phone. -- Who?</seg>
<seg id="3871">21	222	If necessary, we'll fall back on visual confirmation, but since we're talking 700, 000 cubic miles...</seg>
<seg id="3872">12	623	But if the whole matter's gonna be treated as a joke...</seg>
<seg id="3873">37	458	I'm just gonna kill her, man; this is bullshit!</seg>
<seg id="3874">53	400	That was our bust. That is our money.</seg>
<seg id="3875">52	617	I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Just repetition, repetition.</seg>
<seg id="3876">51	564	Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight</seg>
<seg id="3877">44	760	Maybe not. Can you pull over and get this?</seg>
<seg id="3878">19	193	And according to you, I can't trust any of my law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="3879">6	630	Yes, but I'm waiting for her husband to die.</seg>
<seg id="3880">21	94	Just please don't hurt her again. I'll do whatever you want.</seg>
<seg id="3881">49	51	I'm drawing in on the Hood investigation.</seg>
<seg id="3882">11	533	This is all about protecting the town.</seg>
<seg id="3883">48	10	Oliver, this is my daughter, Helena.</seg>
<seg id="3884">35	94	Well, that and my mom sold the house, - Yeah. - and moved to Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3885">53	310	I think he was counting down days till he could go back to hanging out with his friends after school, instead of manning the phones here.</seg>
<seg id="3886">54	348	They got divorced about five years ago so it wasn't like he had to hang out with me.</seg>
<seg id="3887">47	462	I'll check it out. - Alright.</seg>
<seg id="3888">4	654	I'll pass with not receiving the trifle presents.</seg>
<seg id="3889">54	606	We lost track of each other and ...</seg>
<seg id="3890">38	118	What is going on with this show?</seg>
<seg id="3891">42	323	IT'S ABOUT LISTENING TO A PHOTOGRAPHER OR DIRECTOR'S VISION AND DELIVERING THAT MESSAGE.</seg>
<seg id="3892">19	636	The Americans have been playing us.</seg>
<seg id="3893">16	445	Then you'll be responsible for everything that happens.</seg>
<seg id="3894">53	154	I don't know what you want...</seg>
<seg id="3895">52	170	Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?</seg>
<seg id="3896">13	529	Mr. Secretary, I can have a room prepared for yo to rest, if you like.</seg>
<seg id="3897">14	125	We've just received a video feed confirming that another hostage has been executed inside the main terminal at Ontario Airport.</seg>
<seg id="3898">25	350	and, uh, oh yeah, this is going to be awesome right here.</seg>
<seg id="3899">27	108	Hell, no. I mean, I love me some barack obama, but in this case, change is bad.</seg>
<seg id="3900">45	35	I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. No, honey.</seg>
<seg id="3901">13	68	Give us the worst-case casualty scenarios, Curtis.</seg>
<seg id="3902">31	492	It was insightful, well structured, beautifully written.</seg>
<seg id="3903">10	231	My mom saw your mother in the supermarket wearing dirty overalls with chopsticks in her hair and arguing with the butcher.</seg>
<seg id="3904">7	129	A lot of 1 999 black BMW 765s...</seg>
<seg id="3905">20	383	I never thought Jonas would take it this far.</seg>
<seg id="3906">5	195	I don't dare to look at the garden</seg>
<seg id="3907">52	1227	See the world we come from.</seg>
<seg id="3908">45	957	Eames! Eames, get to the antechamber now!</seg>
<seg id="3909">49	33	She said that Walter found it in their bedroom.</seg>
<seg id="3910">20	517	Jack, I know what you've done today, the sacrifice you've made.</seg>
<seg id="3911">34	177	Dixon, you're, like, a million miles away right now. I don't know... I just thought you'd be a little bit more excited to go out, since...</seg>
<seg id="3912">52	558	You may tell her what to do.</seg>
<seg id="3913">23	101	Can you explain that to me? Because I just don't get it.</seg>
<seg id="3914">42	313	AND THIS PHOTO REPRESENTS THE GIRL THAT IS A FINALIST.</seg>
<seg id="3915">55	166	Apparently, Gabe has overtaken the command room.</seg>
<seg id="3916">33	489	But I also know how cute you look when you're angry.</seg>
<seg id="3917">20	136	It's a good thing you sealed off the canister, Mr. Bauer.</seg>
<seg id="3918">15	574	Team B, take the front entrance off the street.</seg>
<seg id="3919">45	861	I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.</seg>
<seg id="3920">33	460	And that's why I'm not going to tell anyone.</seg>
<seg id="3921">55	79	I owe you a large beer, my friend. -- Y-You owe me a ring.</seg>
<seg id="3922">29	476	Uh,Erin here bought herself a ticket to kansas.</seg>
<seg id="3923">31	204	Oh, my god. Naomi's wearing sweats? - Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="3924">17	437	Jack, if they're wrong, you could blow this.</seg>
<seg id="3925">41	503	And it became our responsibility to make sure my brothers and sisters could eat.</seg>
<seg id="3926">31	586	So, thanks, everyone, for coming down.</seg>
<seg id="3927">31	559	What? - What, you thought that was an accident?</seg>
<seg id="3928">45	277	Just be back before the kick. Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.</seg>
<seg id="3929">26	75	Okay, plus, did you see the way he kept, like, glancing at mom the entire time and what was she doing, holding his cue cards?</seg>
<seg id="3930">11	225	The first film I ever saw.</seg>
<seg id="3931">19	461	I've got Vossler. You got his wife?</seg>
<seg id="3932">16	425	All I know is, you have a gun and you have breached airplane security.</seg>
<seg id="3933">17	448	Ctu, we just lost video and audio.</seg>
<seg id="3934">32	203	I'm sorry. No, I don't, either. I just... -  Um... No, no, no, it wasn't...</seg>
<seg id="3935">14	843	Maybe it's a mistake to write down Jack's new information.</seg>
<seg id="3936">14	1050	Make sure your men don't hit me when they come in.</seg>
<seg id="3937">11	301	Watching a movie. Some crap thing...</seg>
<seg id="3938">49	251	You're spying on her?! - Just doing my due diligence, Oliver.</seg>
<seg id="3939">44	729	And it doesn't have to be me but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.</seg>
<seg id="3940">35	297	Call me a dreamer, but I was kind of hoping she'd get eaten by a lion.</seg>
<seg id="3941">24	302	You know, pre-show jitters, I think.</seg>
<seg id="3942">17	28	The tally's seven to six in favor of invoking the 25th amendment and removing president Palmer from power.</seg>
<seg id="3943">43	333	That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!</seg>
<seg id="3944">53	384	To be honest with you, I'm not really here on a social call.</seg>
<seg id="3945">45	975	As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital and we all ride the kick back up the layers.</seg>
<seg id="3946">47	161	Jana's husband Stan is a police officer, who happened to have been making a deposit at Starling Trust Bank.</seg>
<seg id="3947">43	281	In a dream, your mind functions more quickly therefore time seems to feel more slow.</seg>
<seg id="3948">11	11	Mr.  President, if  you'll excuse me.</seg>
<seg id="3949">49	305	There's some sort of infatuation thing going on here.</seg>
<seg id="3950">41	584	Well, this is a good dream with a happy ending.</seg>
<seg id="3951">38	248	Oh, please, guys. Check down the back of the sofa for your self-respect.</seg>
<seg id="3952">15	179	Okay, insert the new chip in the slot, press the reset button under the slot.</seg>
<seg id="3953">24	47	What happened to my light, Silver?</seg>
<seg id="3954">26	424	Now I have to give a crap what I look like.  You made it.</seg>
<seg id="3955">42	295	IT COULD BE AN ARMOR, BUT IT'S STILL AN ARMOR</seg>
<seg id="3956">20	353	Larry debriefed the White House and we're waiting on the president to decide on a course of action.</seg>
<seg id="3957">6	212	Don't force me to shoot you.</seg>
<seg id="3958">11	638	take care of Mari for me.</seg>
<seg id="3959">40	262	I don't want Ryan. He's too skinny.</seg>
<seg id="3960">42	194	AND HERE IS YOUR BEST TAKE.</seg>
<seg id="3961">27	374	She's perfectly safe, I assure you she's in palm springs.</seg>
<seg id="3962">15	98	They should have it in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="3963">52	1169	The Sky People have sent us a message that they can take whatever they want and no one can stop them.</seg>
<seg id="3964">39	323	Ryan, what's going on out there, man?</seg>
<seg id="3965">51	285	Look, I know you probably don't understand this but thank you</seg>
<seg id="3966">31	462	Uh, north shore. I mean, it's, like, one of the most beautiful...</seg>
<seg id="3967">3	512	...so that they didn't want for anything, and they didn't.</seg>
<seg id="3968">31	453	Jazz... just moved to L. A. From kauai.</seg>
<seg id="3969">21	364	You want to capture Margot Al-Harazi, you're gonna have to do it my way.</seg>
<seg id="3970">3	103	I hate these... I hate tubes!</seg>
<seg id="3971">51	581	And you may choose a woman</seg>
<seg id="3972">48	102	I just want us to agree to be honest with one another, moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="3973">51	572	You are now a son of the Omaticaya</seg>
<seg id="3974">20	243	Well, I'm truly flattered, ma'am, but as you know, I'm retired.</seg>
<seg id="3975">37	375	We're not going to be part of your reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="3976">4	755	What cooperation do you need, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="3977">37	323	Give me your phone. - Hayden, no.</seg>
<seg id="3978">48	342	Helena, it was very nice to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="3979">49	505	And I'm not willing to take them with you.</seg>
<seg id="3980">54	84	Not me. -- Annie was my assistant.</seg>
<seg id="3981">3	544	Maybe because you called her the sequel.</seg>
<seg id="3982">43	672	You know where you hope this train will take you but you don't know for sure.</seg>
<seg id="3983">30	234	Apparently, he's going to go pro in a year.</seg>
<seg id="3984">6	625	Why do you want to be rich?</seg>
<seg id="3985">42	284	IT'S A DIFFERENT LACK OF CONFIDENCE FROM ANYA,</seg>
<seg id="3986">52	887	Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya - in a way you can't imagine. -- You know what?</seg>
<seg id="3987">18	107	Look, Jack, I read your file.</seg>
<seg id="3988">4	496	In order to develop the region, - Building a casino or a golf course...</seg>
<seg id="3989">53	419	Next that will happen, they'll subpoena your bank records, and you spend the rest of your life in prison like Cooper.</seg>
<seg id="3990">16	180	What do they think I'm going to do? Kill myself?</seg>
<seg id="3991">38	313	And she kind of sat me down and said,"I'm not gonna lie to you.</seg>
<seg id="3992">20	566	FBI? I'll need to get authorization from my superior.</seg>
<seg id="3993">37	410	You think I'm gonna fall for that?</seg>
<seg id="3994">21	557	You didn't watch the person you love burn to death.</seg>
<seg id="3995">52	121	Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.</seg>
<seg id="3996">20	224	And I think you should be the one who debriefs him.</seg>
<seg id="3997">7	123	Until they pass a law that says i can't.</seg>
<seg id="3998">14	316	You're aware if this document finds its way into the wrong hands, that you'll be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="3999">38	167	Please. Please let me sing another song for you.</seg>
<seg id="4000">27	96	I love you, snookums. I love you, please.</seg>
<seg id="4001">5	189	She has special recipe with soups</seg>
<seg id="4002">31	249	So why not give it another shot?</seg>
<seg id="4003">30	186	You know, between you and me, pearls remind me of old ladies.</seg>
<seg id="4004">32	680	Who'd you guys get to, uh, be the waiter?</seg>
<seg id="4005">37	313	To you, Hayden, for handling this with grace and maturity.</seg>
<seg id="4006">42	379	BUT DEFINITELY A SHOW YOU WANT TO BE IN.</seg>
<seg id="4007">45	76	Not consciously, anyway. How about instinctively, huh?</seg>
<seg id="4008">39	22	Well, we'll just discuss this over lunch, randy.</seg>
<seg id="4009">13	435	Curtis wanted me to tell you that as soon as Audrey recognizes somebody from the surveillance video, he wants it sent directly to my system. I'm on 60 Casper.</seg>
<seg id="4010">33	480	I mean, I know most girls love diamonds, but I look at them and I think about slave mining and orphans in Sierra Leone and these mistresses in Texas with their hair- sprayed hair</seg>
<seg id="4011">15	153	Was he working with the terrorists?</seg>
<seg id="4012">44	299	Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.</seg>
<seg id="4013">2	60	Let's dance like a flower and butterfly.</seg>
<seg id="4014">16	434	Captain, I know you can hear me. There is a man on board your plane that is a danger to you. That's why I am here.</seg>
<seg id="4015">21	175	Mr. President, Jack Bauer was telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="4016">48	176	Well, any associate of Oliver's is</seg>
<seg id="4017">32	200	I'm sorry, Silver, I wanted to be there for you.</seg>
<seg id="4018">6	640	He really said that? - On his deathbed.</seg>
<seg id="4019">29	470	I mean,kids grow up way too fast, and we made a huge mistake by coming here.</seg>
<seg id="4020">38	293	Sweet, yeah. - Really liked her.</seg>
<seg id="4021">14	436	Counting down from 60 seconds  on my mark.</seg>
<seg id="4022">51	661	You throw a stick in the air around here it's gonna land on some sacred fern -for Christ's sake! --I'm not talking about some kind of pagan voodoo here. I'm talking about something real something measurable in the biology of the forest</seg>
<seg id="4023">31	530	So what if I am? It's obviously working.</seg>
<seg id="4024">23	358	what can I get you ladies?</seg>
<seg id="4025">27	134	You've been hanging out with your new friends and i've just been busy.</seg>
<seg id="4026">43	774	I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire. -- You had no right.</seg>
<seg id="4027">42	208	SO LET'S SEE YOUR BEST PHOTO.</seg>
<seg id="4028">14	1086	What's happening?  -Ma'am, I need you to step back to the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="4029">40	80	I gotta say no. You can't really hear the melody.</seg>
<seg id="4030">52	585	Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.</seg>
<seg id="4031">16	248	That's all I need right now is to deal with her!</seg>
<seg id="4032">51	313	Well, then teach me how to See -No one can teach you to See. --Whoa</seg>
<seg id="4033">39	118	Thank you, guys! - See you at the final.</seg>
<seg id="4034">51	140	Keep your arms in, hands in, head down</seg>
<seg id="4035">51	3	Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up in cryo, you don't dream at all it doesn't feel like six years</seg>
<seg id="4036">11	259	This is a piece of that blanket.</seg>
<seg id="4037">4	640	To submit for the construction of a nuclear waste center.</seg>
<seg id="4038">4	42	I doubt it. He wouldn't even listen to us.</seg>
<seg id="4039">47	281	We can make do with what we've got. - We'll be okay.</seg>
<seg id="4040">26	269	I don't know. I got my meeting after school.</seg>
<seg id="4041">21	476	She spends her whole life dedicated to planning that attack, and then, makes a dumb mistake like this?</seg>
<seg id="4042">22	81	Ms. Casey, I have to tell you,</seg>
<seg id="4043">6	512	You go on. - We'll see.</seg>
<seg id="4044">52	1231	More Sky People are gonna come.</seg>
<seg id="4045">32	439	This tech guy saved the entire thing.</seg>
<seg id="4046">21	34	Well, he should be. Son of a bitch shot two of my men.</seg>
<seg id="4047">54	575	Liam Tell. He's some guy I know who knows some other guys.</seg>
<seg id="4048">42	67	SO YOU HAVE TIME TO LEARN THEM.</seg>
<seg id="4049">45	1048	You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="4050">43	335	I see you met Mrs. Cobb. -- She's his wife?</seg>
<seg id="4051">16	46	Chloe's packing the comm gear she needs to stay in touch with Jack.</seg>
<seg id="4052">29	359	Now can you leave me alone?!</seg>
<seg id="4053">14	738	Is Jack okay? We don't know.</seg>

<seg id="5481">25	55	And you did share a - What did you call it?</seg>
<seg id="5482">14	567	Well, if you hadn't recognized the duress code that Jack transmitted, well...</seg>
<seg id="5483">51	464	I gotta run! Okay? Let's go</seg>
<seg id="5484">31	200	Why are you wearing sweatpants? Are you okay?</seg>
<seg id="5485">19	490	You tell me now, or the situation for your family goes from bad to worse.</seg>
<seg id="5486">29	232	Why did you turn your phone off? - Silver called.</seg>
<seg id="5487">10	211	I bet Stu is hard to get along with.</seg>
<seg id="5488">52	1310	I got movement, I got movement.</seg>
<seg id="5489">52	401	If you love your little forest friends, why not let them just kill my ass?</seg>
<seg id="5490">4	264	I can feel that this man will leave his name in the history books.</seg>
<seg id="5491">41	102	Let's talk about how creative it is.</seg>
<seg id="5492">53	139	Cooper wants something. I need to know what.</seg>
<seg id="5493">25	495	Yeah, well, he must be really into you, girl, 'cause he really wanted to come to this dance.</seg>
<seg id="5494">34	1020	How dare you! - How dare I what?</seg>
<seg id="5495">24	653	You know, you actually did a pretty good job tonight, Dixon.</seg>
<seg id="5496">1	202	Nice to meet you -You too.</seg>
<seg id="5497">13	224	Nothing. Just stay off Hub Five. I need it.</seg>
<seg id="5498">38	744	Hilary's gonna say, god, that just-- Well, Randy, he was in your key.</seg>
<seg id="5499">21	70	Tanner's flight key? Tell me you didn't steal it.</seg>
<seg id="5500">43	797	COBB: That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.</seg>
<seg id="5501">31	569	So, we should get going if we want to catch the bus.</seg>
<seg id="5502">34	1011	Hey, maybe I should just... - Shh. Shh!</seg>
<seg id="5503">35	81	I am a nobody at CU. - Uh, you haven't started yet.</seg>
<seg id="5504">39	110	Right, okay, Chris, what is the local fox affiliate here?</seg>
<seg id="5505">52	1118	But to ever face them again,</seg>
<seg id="5506">47	82	Ok, without Stagg, how long can CNRI keep the doors open?</seg>
<seg id="5507">17	288	Jack Bauer wasn't able to extract any information from Fayed.</seg>
<seg id="5508">44	61	Did she tell you? Or have you known all along?</seg>
<seg id="5509">32	278	Annie, you were kissing him when we told you that we didn't want you to see him!</seg>
<seg id="5510">24	652	It didn't look like that to me, not from the make-out session that I saw.</seg>
<seg id="5511">20	509	We got a location on the weapon, - we're getting ready to stage a raid on the compound. - I want to go.</seg>
<seg id="5512">14	631	PALMER: I need to talk to you.</seg>
<seg id="5513">3	35	Same year the supreme court ruled...</seg>
<seg id="5514">51	273	Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?</seg>
<seg id="5515">52	54	You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there.</seg>
<seg id="5516">43	182	So do you want to take a leap of faith or become an old man, filled with regret waiting to die alone?</seg>
<seg id="5517">19	161	Also, Motobo must be delivered to my men</seg>
<seg id="5518">33	209	Uh, maybe some water for the table.</seg>
<seg id="5519">29	537	Everything was so great,but now it's so dark.</seg>
<seg id="5520">55	165	This is a high security building.</seg>
<seg id="5521">52	1063	Clear. Come on. -- Here you go.</seg>
<seg id="5522">13	516	I need to update an evacuation strategy.</seg>
<seg id="5523">13	103	Paul, please, can we just do this later?</seg>
<seg id="5524">51	317	You should not be here --Okay, take me with you. --No! Go back</seg>
<seg id="5525">19	406	According to the Secret Service log, his shift starts at 4: 00 p. m.</seg>
<seg id="5526">51	65	This is where we're connecting to the avatar</seg>
<seg id="5527">40	408	Yes, doesn't matter what the--what are you talking about?</seg>
<seg id="5528">20	640	You're on private property, and we're prepared to defend it if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="5529">29	583	So,there are a lot of other fish in the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5530">22	512	Adrianna, you're never gonna be like them again.</seg>
<seg id="5531">40	612	I'm--I’m just acting like myself right now.</seg>
<seg id="5532">20	643	We're protecting our rights against a hostile government that's using false charges to try to shut us down.</seg>
<seg id="5533">20	373	I told him to put Almeida down if he didn't start talking.</seg>
<seg id="5534">52	1247	Suit Team, go. -- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!</seg>
<seg id="5535">41	439	You know, the '50s. wasn't it?</seg>
<seg id="5536">55	24	I'm awake with my wife, and I close me eyes, I open them...I'm awake with my son.</seg>
<seg id="5537">43	658	As I'm about to call out to them they run away.</seg>
<seg id="5538">7	165	Maybe I'll come back later for that coffee.</seg>
<seg id="5539">40	600	That was hot, I love it. what's that mean?</seg>
<seg id="5540">40	3	This is Miami, friends, and this is american idol!</seg>
<seg id="5541">37	78	He was trying to freak us both out.</seg>
<seg id="5542">26	196	You just got to be prepared in case Naomi asks you to do something.</seg>
<seg id="5543">11	485	Prepare a fitting death scene for Della Togashi.</seg>
<seg id="5544">43	823	They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="5545">24	362	Yes, I'm very, very proud of her.</seg>
<seg id="5546">33	42	Liam, this has been a really crazy year.</seg>
<seg id="5547">25	697	What the hell are you doing? - Get out!</seg>
<seg id="5548">6	184	But ever since your mother died, you've been...</seg>
<seg id="5549">5	459	Nowadays, such attitude is not good enough...</seg>
<seg id="5550">14	23	You make any efforts  to enter the tunnel,  you will spend the rest of  the day collecting body parts.</seg>
<seg id="5551">24	366	Good, because you have three agents coming.</seg>
<seg id="5552">17	313	The prime minister has asked me to convey his gratitude to you for stopping the attack on our country and his relief that an international catastrophe was narrowly avoided.</seg>
<seg id="5553">52	127	Well, here I am, doing science.</seg>
<seg id="5554">42	274	SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE'S DREAMING ABOUT FIELDS AND PASTURES.</seg>
<seg id="5555">43	718	It's not. -- Maybe we could share.</seg>
<seg id="5556">14	648	Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?</seg>
<seg id="5557">52	1225	But if you're there, I need to give you a heads-up.</seg>
<seg id="5558">45	667	Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.</seg>
<seg id="5559">11	394	I'll take care of the rest</seg>
<seg id="5560">52	40	Tommy was the scientist, not me.</seg>
<seg id="5561">11	10	Laughing in the face of their bullets.</seg>
<seg id="5562">19	59	There's no point in screaming or trying to call for help.</seg>
<seg id="5563">10	305	Now, as you know, "Pygmalion" is a play which takes place in old-timey London.</seg>
<seg id="5564">49	151	The giant sucking sound you're hearing is the current power vacuum in Starling City, the one that I plan on filling.</seg>
<seg id="5565">16	325	The man seated next to me-- where is he?</seg>
<seg id="5566">21	72	Chloe O'Brian? Yes. He's using her to analyze the flight key data.</seg>
<seg id="5567">32	245	When you get home from school, we are gonna have a talk.</seg>
<seg id="5568">34	881	You think Oprah would have me?</seg>
<seg id="5569">27	207	I was pretty explicit about this, tabitha.</seg>
<seg id="5570">20	41	We need you to get undressed.</seg>
<seg id="5571">15	42	Has Erwich set a time and place for the meeting yet?</seg>
<seg id="5572">47	236	Agent? I thought you were a neurosurgeon, Carter.</seg>
<seg id="5573">25	254	I'm actually here to do a story for the blaze news.</seg>
<seg id="5574">52	97	Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman. I went through avatar training with him.</seg>
<seg id="5575">22	689	The fight that we had at the beach.</seg>
<seg id="5576">31	282	I just have to find a way to get into cu. And I will.</seg>
<seg id="5577">43	276	ARIADNE: How did architects become involved?</seg>
<seg id="5578">55	378	And that's a good enough reason to steal?</seg>
<seg id="5579">40	283	But I really do love you-- - Corliss, you love Paula too, don't you?</seg>
<seg id="5580">45	41	What does that mean? I filed a letter with our attorney explaining how l'm fearful for my safety.</seg>
<seg id="5581">49	473	24 is the exact number of arrows he carries in his quive and flechettes around his forearm.</seg>
<seg id="5582">40	68	Shannon, it sounds like you're eating when you sing.</seg>
<seg id="5583">5	246	...While his two daughter wept openly</seg>
<seg id="5584">38	704	Also Aaron Lewis from staind. So I also study a little bit of Michael Jackson.</seg>
<seg id="5585">11	457	It's not the Iead. Some regional dinner theater show...</seg>
<seg id="5586">26	19	So, I have something that I would like to discuss as a family member, when I was in high school, I dated Tracy Clark.</seg>
<seg id="5587">13	340	I need you to do something. Look at me. Maya, look at me.</seg>
<seg id="5588">22	476	Like, I don't even get it.</seg>
<seg id="5589">21	92	She'll recover, no thanks to you.</seg>
<seg id="5590">44	363	you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.</seg>
<seg id="5591">48	305	No, no, we're just gonna have a drink and - We'd love to.</seg>
<seg id="5592">49	396	Yeah, it would have been a little awkward for you to explain to my mother that you're spying on her.</seg>
<seg id="5593">44	667	Not these. These are my dreams.</seg>
<seg id="5594">12	802	Underneath, it said, "Industrial Prince of England.</seg>
<seg id="5595">52	114	Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you. -- Good to meet you, yeah.</seg>
<seg id="5596">24	245	What is this-- "The Last Virgin Wins"?</seg>
<seg id="5597">11	233	What I fear is Iiving on without honor.</seg>
<seg id="5598">21	97	So far, I've set up data-links with four of the drones.</seg>
<seg id="5599">30	633	Come on, come on. it's okay.</seg>
<seg id="5600">14	248	Look, I can't have you micro-managing my work here, Lynn.</seg>
<seg id="5601">51	664	And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it</seg>
<seg id="5602">2	167	Don't be afraid. lt's almost out.</seg>
<seg id="5603">53	93	Have you considered that maybe you want to protect something else?</seg>
<seg id="5604">44	631	Snaps you out of the dream.</seg>
<seg id="5605">19	341	Tourniquet is as tight as possible?</seg>
<seg id="5606">17	414	Make sure Fayed's vehicle and the follow car have a wide berth.</seg>
<seg id="5607">26	555	Apparently, there are still a bunch of boys around here.  Hey, cutie.</seg>
<seg id="5608">16	646	Yeah. I just... got a cramp in my leg.</seg>
<seg id="5609">3	95	That was a good one. Ha-ha-ha. - Yeah, it's good stuff.</seg>
<seg id="5610">25	111	Oh, my god, I'm here too.</seg>
<seg id="5611">47	100	What am I saying? Of course you haven't.</seg>
<seg id="5612">14	1117	I have just received word that the crisis at the Ontario Airport is over.</seg>
<seg id="5613">53	200	It's also where the pay phone is located, sir.</seg>
<seg id="5614">4	61	And who're you? - Oh, I'm from the town office.</seg>
<seg id="5615">4	213	Making difference between elected person and dropout.</seg>
<seg id="5616">27	478	Because if that's what you want to do, I’ll do it.</seg>
<seg id="5617">19	478	I don't know. She's got Conner.</seg>
<seg id="5618">30	343	You have to understand, this is really important to Navid.</seg>
<seg id="5619">24	251	Doesn't everyone want what Ethan and I have?</seg>
<seg id="5620">55	429	What? -- What's going on?! What are they doing?!</seg>
<seg id="5621">20	498	See if you can get a hold of a hand radio.</seg>
<seg id="5622">14	1014	I'll need the entire transcripts of your communications with Mr. Bauer since he's been inside.</seg>
<seg id="5623">5	301	Or else I'd be a Chicken-Flu-Chicken</seg>
<seg id="5624">29	259	Heard about her little movie, so I figured it'd shed some light on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="5625">14	470	What is CTU waiting for?!  -I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="5626">33	406	The important thing is that we stick together.</seg>
<seg id="5627">44	568	So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.</seg>
<seg id="5628">54	365	After a while, I just gave up and moved on.</seg>
<seg id="5629">51	929	And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan that didn't involve martyrdom</seg>
<seg id="5630">20	332	They just cleared security. He's on his way up.</seg>
<seg id="5631">48	511	Not sure into what yet, but...</seg>
<seg id="5632">40	241	Corliss liked them a little more beefy.</seg>
<seg id="5633">31	281	I'm not going to let some college counselor, who wears an ankle bracelet under her stockings, get in my way.</seg>
<seg id="5634">3	269	You'll, uh, call us when you get your test results, huh?</seg>
<seg id="5635">55	93	There was totally a sign there, and you blew right through it.</seg>
<seg id="5636">31	423	You know what, I wish we could put pictures of choking dolphins on the bottles.</seg>
<seg id="5637">15	540	They believe there's a good chance he'll lead them to Erwich and the rest of the canisters.</seg>
<seg id="5638">26	52	I'm just really hoping that this doesn't affect us in any way.</seg>
<seg id="5639">2	308	Where's the driver? -l sent him away.</seg>
<seg id="5640">35	64	Got a towel for a fellow classmate? - You go to CU?</seg>
<seg id="5641">48	104	Will you give me a lift to school?</seg>
<seg id="5642">32	449	Good luck, darling! - Break a leg!</seg>
<seg id="5643">24	142	Well, I am, I'm going to have a talk with her when she comes home.</seg>
<seg id="5644">3	431	It was not supposed to be about guns blazing or anything like that.</seg>
<seg id="5645">19	492	How do I know you're just not going to kill them anyway?</seg>
<seg id="5646">41	143	I recently made the big move to Nashville.</seg>
<seg id="5647">39	450	I miss, like, all the family things.</seg>
<seg id="5648">22	198	You don't seem like you know it.</seg>
<seg id="5649">29	444	With what seems to be pots on your heads?</seg>
<seg id="5650">19	547	That's 15 minutes more than we had.</seg>
<seg id="5651">37	243	never turns her back on her child.</seg>
<seg id="5652">21	328	Dad, maybe Mark made the right call. Let's not forget who the enemy is.</seg>
<seg id="5653">17	411	All shadow teams for Bauer and Doyle have checked in and are standing by.</seg>
<seg id="5654">34	404	And that's gotta count for something.</seg>
<seg id="5655">13	80	I'm projecting the first radiation shock waves in approximately three hours.</seg>
<seg id="5656">21	171	Data recovered from Tanner's flight key.</seg>
<seg id="5657">39	569	I think you got a nice voice, man, but work on some persona, perform, watch the mirror, look in the mirror.</seg>
<seg id="5658">10	280	I told her I think it's really rigid to stick to the original.</seg>
<seg id="5659">32	282	Yeah, well, you know what, you can control what I do at home, but you can't control what I do at school.</seg>
<seg id="5660">11	585	I won't see you for a while.</seg>
<seg id="5661">41	487	But for others a chance to go on to Vegas and compete for the million dollar prize.</seg>
<seg id="5662">15	128	Evelyn, I'm helping prepare a statement right now that the President's gonna give later.</seg>
<seg id="5663">42	338	NOW YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE NOW.</seg>
<seg id="5664">14	587	We've got a problem-- one of the hostages is missing.</seg>
<seg id="5665">21	93	A mother should never have to see her daughter go through something like that.</seg>
<seg id="5666">52	534	Tsu'tey. -- He'll be the next clan leader.</seg>
<seg id="5667">51	475	Excuse me. This is my video log here</seg>
<seg id="5668">44	798	No. It won't wake him up.</seg>
<seg id="5669">33	415	No one's going to know I'm your mom.</seg>
<seg id="5670">1	631	He still could show, you know -You didn't see his face.</seg>
<seg id="5671">16	144	Oh, hey. I was just asking.</seg>
<seg id="5672">51	223	Yeah. they could fix me up, if I rotated back</seg>
<seg id="5673">11	286	What kind of a movie, eh? Kid?</seg>
<seg id="5674">29	557	We didn't end up leaving the motel room.</seg>
<seg id="5675">44	215	But after what happened there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.</seg>
<seg id="5676">22	250	Mr. Matthews probably didn't want to be hurt by what you said, but he was.</seg>
<seg id="5677">52	136	Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.</seg>
<seg id="5678">25	657	No, no, I-I don't, but if it hurts you this much to watch Adrianna do this to herself, then what are you gonna do if you really lose her?</seg>
<seg id="5679">19	89	Doesn't make sense. - I know.</seg>
<seg id="5680">25	558	I can't take it anymore I can't keep trying to save you when you won't even try to save yourself.</seg>
<seg id="5681">3	551	You're just afraid your chute won't open and you'll show up at your own funeral as a denver omelet.</seg>
<seg id="5682">35	248	I made a bigger production when I asked Silver if I could keep my toothbrush at her place.</seg>
<seg id="5683">33	517	I wish I were stronger, Liam, I really wish I were.</seg>
<seg id="5684">45	929	Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.</seg>
<seg id="5685">19	87	Fbi agent named Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.</seg>
<seg id="5686">43	21	And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep your defense is never down.</seg>
<seg id="5687">48	40	She is tougher than she looks.</seg>
<seg id="5688">44	819	There weren't meant to be risks.</seg>
<seg id="5689">52	156	You see that? -- Yes, sir.</seg>
<seg id="5690">51	594	Don't forget your phase integration --Jake! --No, no, the middle button --You gotta eat something. --Yeah, there you go</seg>
<seg id="5691">42	429	WATCH IT, OOH, I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO COLLIDE.</seg>
<seg id="5692">20	427	Janis, set up a secure connection in the conference room with Almeida and the White House for this signature.</seg>
<seg id="5693">14	557	Whoa, and what situation is that?</seg>
<seg id="5694">23	547	by the way, Kelly asked me if I could babysit on Sunday and I don't think I can.</seg>
<seg id="5695">10	304	I'm telling all the others about this idea that I have had for our production of "Pygmalion.</seg>
<seg id="5696">22	284	Kiddo, your mother's going through  kind of a tough time.</seg>
<seg id="5697">21	342	She just made a video in which she said she would forgo the attacks if I would surrender to her within three hours.</seg>
<seg id="5698">22	196	I had to, Ade. You're pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="5699">22	405	My decision to transfer Silver out had nothing to do with you, okay, or us.</seg>
<seg id="5700">48	394	It was going so well for you.</seg>
<seg id="5701">25	608	Really? You have it covered? - Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="5702">29	135	Hello? - Nope, Dixon's not answering.</seg>
<seg id="5703">29	534	I know. - Don't! Don't come near me.</seg>
<seg id="5704">25	73	So, I mean we could go, you know, and make fun of people if that's what you want.</seg>
<seg id="5705">15	268	Repeat-- the intended target is the Sunrise Hills Mall.</seg>
<seg id="5706">43	516	And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</seg>
<seg id="5707">51	1	I started having these dreams of flying</seg>
<seg id="5708">32	366	As kirkegaard would say, doubt is conquered by faith...</seg>
<seg id="5709">5	185	I have nothing to do with this</seg>
<seg id="5710">34	817	Well, good thing I took notes during SAT prep course.</seg>
<seg id="5711">52	134	She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book,</seg>
<seg id="5712">52	891	What we think we know is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees, like the synapses between neurons.</seg>
<seg id="5713">2	44	When l feel anger or sadness burning my insides, hammering makes it all go away. Only blacksmiths know that.</seg>
<seg id="5714">22	680	And then he actually started telling me...</seg>

<seg id="7617">51	418	You should go away. --No, you'd miss me</seg>
<seg id="7618">47	327	It's called not being a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="7619">29	290	I'm gonna go check the cafeteria. - Cool.</seg>

<seg id="7635">27	303	Hey, you want to go to palm spring - where? - Palm springs.</seg>
<seg id="7636">41	567	We're going to vote now, Kyle.</seg>

<seg id="7639">48	365	So, making me have dinner with the love of your life is what, Oliver?</seg>
<seg id="7640">52	956	Listen to me. You've got one hour.</seg>
<seg id="7641">54	164	Look like he's been pretty much executed.</seg>
<seg id="7642">35	351	I promise, once you're there, you're gonna feel better.</seg>
<seg id="7643">31	291	Oh, shoot. I forgot to tell you something.</seg>
<seg id="7644">39	217	So Jason was leaving the farm for hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="7645">42	189	THE TOP THREE BADDEST CHICK CLUB, WORK IT OUT.</seg>
<seg id="7646">44	26	And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep your defense is never down.</seg>
<seg id="7647">10	481	I can't even imagine being you.</seg>
<seg id="7648">44	668	Why do you do this to yourself?</seg>
<seg id="7649">38	196	Oh, this is good, we get the mom.</seg>
<seg id="7650">52	813	Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!</seg>
<seg id="7651">44	678	Well, what's down there that you regret?</seg>
<seg id="7652">4	223	Maybe your mother did something with it.</seg>
<seg id="7653">19	13	Disengage the cip module. Begin the offload.</seg>
<seg id="7654">6	216	Where are we going? - To our death!</seg>

<seg id="7656">23	714	After next week, you know, I'll cut down9e on a few shifts, but...</seg>
<seg id="7657">22	477	Well, did you talk about it?</seg>
<seg id="7658">21	343	Is there anything that you can tell me that will help us catch her?</seg>
<seg id="7659">4	692	Okay. No benefits for you, then.</seg>
<seg id="7660">49	77	Then we need to find out... - no.</seg>
<seg id="7661">45	1099	I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="7662">49	109	Maybe, if we could do it early.</seg>
<seg id="7663">16	506	And after that, it's all over.</seg>
<seg id="7664">2	484	and begged her to live with me.</seg>
<seg id="7665">41	491	Having a talent saved his life.</seg>
<seg id="7666">49	58	If this man's a hero, I don't know what my life in this city as a cop means.</seg>
<seg id="7667">44	937	That when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious we lost sight of what was real.</seg>
<seg id="7668">51	570	And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation</seg>
<seg id="7669">31	552	And you, you are a pi phi waiting to happen.</seg>
<seg id="7670">47	272	That hood guy showing up, Kyle shooting a cop.</seg>
<seg id="7671">11	214	What will become of me now?</seg>
<seg id="7672">51	256	So, that is signal transduction from this root to the root of the tree next to it. So, we should take a sample</seg>
<seg id="7673">54	177	See the handle on the safe?</seg>
<seg id="7674">5	419	Don't point your finger at me!</seg>
<seg id="7675">6	42	Yes, yes, I'm coming. I'm coming.</seg>
<seg id="7676">27	274	And you know what you did?</seg>
<seg id="7677">6	196	You and I must talk...man to man.</seg>
<seg id="7678">3	9	I believe that you measure yourself by the people who measured themselves by you.</seg>
<seg id="7679">35	12	You're an adult now, and it's your decision, and no!</seg>
<seg id="7680">10	719	Crime has never appealed to me as a way of life.</seg>
<seg id="7681">52	892	And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.</seg>
<seg id="7682">49	134	They can't move on him without evidence of new criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id="7683">12	1307	and people shouting, and the sound of...</seg>
<seg id="7684">17	456	We need you to seal off the north end. We're going in.</seg>
<seg id="7685">43	562	That's what we're here to figure out. Robert's relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least. - Can we run with that?</seg>
<seg id="7686">51	425	Real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here and an inner ring. There's a core structure like a spiral</seg>
<seg id="7687">31	68	As a junior, I'm sure you've already started thinking about where you want to go.</seg>
<seg id="7688">31	518	Why would you ask navid and i on a double date just thought it'd be fun.</seg>
<seg id="7689">19	296	He's gonna transfer your ass to Juneau so fast, your head will spin.</seg>
<seg id="7690">23	680	Look, I don't know what the story is with you and Sammy's dad.</seg>
<seg id="7691">21	526	Uh, we know. We were able to trace the IP to an address. We have a team there right now.</seg>
<seg id="7692">5	212	The shortest, but the biggest of them all is...</seg>
<seg id="7693">43	17	Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor.</seg>
<seg id="7694">4	136	What do you mean, why? Just take a look at this face.</seg>
<seg id="7695">39	136	And as Chris headed off with his dad and his grandma, we barely noticed Paula was missing.</seg>
<seg id="7696">52	650	She says all energy is only borrowed, and one day you have to give it back.</seg>
<seg id="7697">22	122	It's such a dark, tragic role, and I've never done anything like it before.</seg>
<seg id="7698">10	401	Good, 'cause that's the one you got.</seg>
<seg id="7699">27	514	I'm sorry it's all right, it's cool.</seg>
<seg id="7700">52	1135	...I stand before you ready to serve the Omaticaya people.</seg>
<seg id="7701">32	438	I'm telling you, I spilled this gnarly yogurt drink on my laptop,</seg>
<seg id="7702">37	52	Do you think about sex a lot?</seg>
<seg id="7703">17	111	You must understand the fragile political climate of our country.</seg>
<seg id="7704">4	267	I'm sorry but I've got a meeting right now.</seg>
<seg id="7705">47	452	Just imagine, after being granted the miracle of having my child returned to me...</seg>
<seg id="7706">53	140	You're forgetting something. -- I'm sorry, Michael.</seg>
<seg id="7707">16	345	That you're both covering something up.</seg>
<seg id="7708">10	619	So, do you think you could look absolutely perfect in something that you already own?</seg>
<seg id="7709">4	36	Oh, look at him. He's pitiful.</seg>
<seg id="7710">45	132	It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.</seg>
<seg id="7711">45	744	Are you talking about, um, extraction?</seg>
<seg id="7712">2	245	l thought you were the police. My goodness.</seg>
<seg id="7713">32	484	Oh, please tell me you're here to turn this thing off.</seg>
<seg id="7714">22	102	There are no small parts, only small actors.</seg>
<seg id="7715">53	87	No. I just thought... it's going to be hard, but they're doing a whole memorial program for Rex.</seg>
<seg id="7716">22	123	So I'm going to be up all night with Will Shakes studying.</seg>
<seg id="7717">22	650	Well, well, well, the notorious Brian Matthews.</seg>
<seg id="7718">17	506	Gredenko betrayed us. He led ctu right to me.</seg>
<seg id="7719">27	402	I'm just, I'm really kind of nerv .</seg>
<seg id="7720">39	302	No... - Are you gonna hit me?</seg>
<seg id="7721">44	815	So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.</seg>
<seg id="7722">29	350	Because you have done nothing but try to avoid me since you came back to school, so you're not here tonight as my friend.</seg>
<seg id="7723">40	62	That was like the hungarian Janis Joplin or something.</seg>
<seg id="7724">4	457	Let's build a new town hall an eight floor hotel.</seg>
<seg id="7725">39	617	And people pay you for that.</seg>
<seg id="7726">11	566	I was just struggling not to Iet my nose run.</seg>
<seg id="7727">41	104	and your act is that you kick seven bells out of your dad, right?</seg>
<seg id="7728">14	915	I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan.</seg>
<seg id="7729">53	2	I'm awake with my son. And this has been happening since the accident?</seg>

<seg id="7732">39	174	All right, whatcha gonna sing, man?</seg>
<seg id="7733">49	209	Vanch's position is too heavily fortified.</seg>
<seg id="7734">51	463	I'm accepting you. I understand you. So you gotta get this, okay?</seg>
<seg id="7735">44	818	You knew these risks and didn't tell us?</seg>
<seg id="7736">52	567	If you want to hit this thing, it's gonna be complicated.</seg>
<seg id="7737">38	172	Well, we've got to find out.</seg>
<seg id="7738">23	686	Look, Kelly, I just want you to feel like you can talk me, you know, like you can tell me anything, and if there is something going on with you and your ex, then...</seg>
<seg id="7739">16	106	From what I understand, Miles, she got out of CTU right under your nose.</seg>
<seg id="7740">42	46	BECAUSE I'M TRYING MY HARDEST AND DOING MY BEST.</seg>
<seg id="7741">35	536	Whoa, that is some serious weedage.</seg>
<seg id="7742">11	210	How many times do I tell you there aren't any?</seg>
<seg id="7743">37	478	She must have been casing the house. I'd...</seg>

<seg id="7745">24	51	It's your job to tell Jared when the lights go up and when the lights go down.</seg>
<seg id="7746">20	273	There's no cure. If dispersed over a populated area, the results would be catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="7747">26	275	If you guys are drinking, I don't want to be the downer.</seg>
<seg id="7748">14	104	Mrs. Logan, if someone altered the recording, of your conversation with David Palmer, the President needs to know.</seg>
<seg id="7749">19	530	Agent Walker, are you still there?</seg>
<seg id="7750">51	341	I was going to kill him but there was a sign from Eywa</seg>
<seg id="7751">51	366	...You will teach him our way to speak and walk as we do. Why me? That's not fair…</seg>
<seg id="7752">17	273	The general is under tight scrutiny by the government.</seg>
<seg id="7753">22	36	I'm just going to do a job and cash a paychk.</seg>
<seg id="7754">25	389	I always thought an older brother would, you know, look out for me, kick anybody's ass who messed with me, that sort of thing.</seg>
<seg id="7755">12	616	with the exception of the two business interests...</seg>
<seg id="7756">42	626	AND I WANT OTHER WOMEN IN AMERICA TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.</seg>
<seg id="7757">55	558	Yeah. I'm sorry, I feel a little...strange.</seg>
<seg id="7758">25	312	But probably not as happy as you are.</seg>
<seg id="7759">2	37	You get drunk every market day</seg>
<seg id="7760">13	562	No, that's a jump "A", I need a load "A." Damn it, move.</seg>
<seg id="7761">31	71	I'll be going to California University.</seg>
<seg id="7762">40	451	And I’m proud of you. You are my daughter.</seg>
<seg id="7763">49	86	Interns get school credit. I'm more like a court-ordered slave.</seg>
<seg id="7764">15	420	Don't you realize how many more people could die if these men don't lead us to the other 19 canisters?</seg>
<seg id="7765">47	424	Well, I figured the entire Queen family and their checkbooks should be present.</seg>
<seg id="7766">4	263	CEO Baek Man-geun I agree with you on that.</seg>
<seg id="7767">11	78	Owing to certain company activities we need a secret book of accounts to record the money flow behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="7768">10	587	Maybe we can even get our pictures taken together.</seg>
<seg id="7769">19	519	If you get there before I do, I want you to stand down.</seg>
<seg id="7770">53	22	Shut it! I got nothing to lose, Perez.</seg>

<seg id="7773">33	59	Ha, ha. No. I got a haircut.</seg>
<seg id="7774">35	243	I didn't call my dad because there are some things you can't just blurt out, like "I'm gay.</seg>
<seg id="7775">16	622	Sir, my sources have informed me that Evans was a last-second replacement.</seg>
<seg id="7776">26	242	So when my grandmother died, I moved to Kansas to be with my mom.</seg>
<seg id="7777">39	335	Swap with Paula for a second.</seg>
<seg id="7778">32	162	why didn't he go? When I saw him at the hospital, he was all dressed up.</seg>
<seg id="7779">10	3	But there's a strong gust, and the winds change</seg>
<seg id="7780">21	62	I managed to stop them from killing Bauer.</seg>
<seg id="7781">13	43	Jack, did you get the surveillance footage from Hyatt Security?</seg>
<seg id="7782">19	128	Using the cip device as bait was necessary to the undercover operation.</seg>

<seg id="7786">34	588	Oh, and can you label four of them "Silver,</seg>
<seg id="7787">6	571	I've never been in the same bed with any other man other than my dead husband.</seg>
<seg id="7788">31	108	None of that powdered sugar business.</seg>
<seg id="7789">19	175	And I will kill him immediately.</seg>

<seg id="7791">27	351	Spanish architect. - Yeah, sure, right.</seg>
<seg id="7792">11	265	Now? We're still filming. I can't.</seg>
<seg id="7793">25	156	I, I just want you to get better, okay?</seg>
<seg id="7794">38	311	I told my mom one day, I said,"mom,</seg>
<seg id="7795">30	133	I've been...I've been thinking about you nonstop.</seg>
<seg id="7796">24	651	He's probably just giving her a ride.</seg>
<seg id="7797">32	165	Was saying that he had a seizure or something.</seg>
<seg id="7798">35	136	You know, s-some things happen for a reason.</seg>
<seg id="7799">49	70	Right around Christmas, when he...disappeared, he gave me this.</seg>
<seg id="7800">38	417	Well, my man, go right out there and get the golden ticket, baby.</seg>
<seg id="7801">45	955	She is just a projection. Fischer. Fischer is real.</seg>
<seg id="7802">14	755	We don't have one second. We're running out of time to save the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="7803">29	384	Imagine all the moments in dixon's life that made him who he is.</seg>
<seg id="7804">49	447	Jeez... He'll kill her if he doesn't get to you.</seg>
<seg id="7805">52	995	Well, well, well. I'd say diplomacy has failed.</seg>
<seg id="7806">52	1176	And we will show the Sky People that they cannot take whatever they want, and that this, this is our land!</seg>
<seg id="7807">23	474	I'll get you the money, man.</seg>
<seg id="7808">19	610	So you've not reported me to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="7809">40	409	Because you're the one-- Don't do the "what" with the high tone to me.</seg>
<seg id="7810">27	21	And a heat wave in L. A.</seg>
<seg id="7811">5	249	The local Stock Market today twice fell below 10, 000 points</seg>

<seg id="7817">38	616	Why? - I'll leave it alone.</seg>

<seg id="7822">17	302	Karen Hayes is meeting him in the lounge. -All right.</seg>
<seg id="7823">33	357	Notoriously late. Someone's probably throwing a fit or eating a bat or something.</seg>
<seg id="7824">23	722	And I heard you and Mom talking about money problems.</seg>
<seg id="7825">4	748	The gloves and clothing that they wear, those are disposed of on a can and sealed tightly to be stored underground.</seg>
<seg id="7826">5	145	That pressure point shows a bad digestive system</seg>
<seg id="7827">14	416	That many people quit?  -No.</seg>

<seg id="7829">52	540	You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="7830">3	15	Thought I'd get you with the double Harrisons.</seg>
<seg id="7831">53	440	This source the same reason you got IA talking to Mayhew?</seg>
<seg id="7832">45	545	You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man not just to live for him.</seg>
<seg id="7833">40	161	I’m 27, and I’m from Venezuela, Originally.</seg>
<seg id="7834">32	272	We don't really want to be a couple.</seg>
<seg id="7835">35	524	Well, I got news for you, darlin'.</seg>
<seg id="7836">53	167	That means in the eyes of the law, you're as guilty as Cooper.</seg>

<seg id="7838">49	498	My father has the phone now.</seg>

<seg id="7840">37	488	Even in a town this big, people don't just disappear.</seg>
<seg id="7841">22	3	I'm going to have to ask you to take a paid leave of absence.</seg>
<seg id="7842">1	205	But you went out with that Duke Orsino guy, right?</seg>
<seg id="7843">48	297	Maybe you can eat some of those fancy peanuts from behind the bar.</seg>
<seg id="7844">35	5	All this time, you've just been pretending that you wanted to have a life with me?</seg>
<seg id="7845">43	334	She's a real charmer. - Oh.</seg>

<seg id="7848">49	75	Oliver, I have no idea what your father was involved in or with whom.</seg>
<seg id="7849">10	616	Well, the car broke down today.</seg>
<seg id="7850">53	469	I would argue it is Mayhew's fault more than it is yours.</seg>
<seg id="7851">17	294	But he hasn't, right? -No, sir.</seg>
