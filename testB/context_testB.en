i 'll go along with your assessment . let them release the sen@@ tox .
and i want you close by . then stay here with me .
well , he should be . son of a bitch shot two of my men . and he managed not to wound either of them . he is not trying to hurt anyone .
then we need to find out ... - no . if what you say is true and this list is filled with bad people and walter was looking into it , and now he ...
i could do it . all right . brief him on the route into the complex .
you 're not real ? no . no . i 'm a pro@@ jection of your subconscious .
right . you have no idea what you 're talking about . sorry . naomi didn 't believe that we were actually dating .
i put it beside his bed . he hasn 't even noticed . robert we need to talk about a power of attorney .
and i let your father down . i know , in some ways , you@@ -you were still trying to protect me .
madam , take a break . i need your fingerprint here . right here .
it 's not too bad . just a small dent . look , we really need to be somewhere , so i 'd rather not wait around to file a police report .
come on . step back inside so we can talk about this . we 've talked enough .
we 're on 12th . roger that , alpha .

i remember at the beginning of the year when we read this in matthe@@ ws ' class , you went on and on about how much you liked it , and how amazing it was that fla@@ u@@ bert could write from a woman 's perspective , and how much that inspired you . and i thought to myself , whe@@ w , stay away from that girl . she 's way too much . that 's what you thought , huh ? - oh , yeah . mm-hmm ?
give me the phone . lau@@ rel could have been hurt , or worse .
my men are already in position . they moved the hostages within the kill zone .

i 'll do my best to put pressure on the ambassador , bill . maybe they can force ha@@ bi@@ b to make that call .
we haven 't talked about it in awhile ... but i do think there 's something else after this life .
you have to leave , or you 're gonna die . are you certain of this ?
how are you ? and who are you guys ?
i think maybe then they 'd think tw@@ t e ab@@ ou@@ using them . yeah , choking dolphins would be awesome .

i jerk off a lot to make the visions to go away . blood and the car@@ n@@ age .

it 's not your fault . the rest@@ ons aren 't the victims . my family stole from this city .
relax , okay ? i said i 'm having doubts . she 's not in the clear yet .
we 're not english , and this isn 't the 19th century , so i think we should adapt the classi@@ cs to reflect our times . they 're classi@@ cs because they 're classic .
were the terrorists to carry out their intentions ... good news , sir .
just by my family is really , really happy for me . a time like this means a lot to me right now , because in the past , you know , i didn 't have very , very happy times .
he 's coming out right now . -- jake . jake ! come on back , kid . come on . that 's it .

it 's more important that she gets away . good . i 'll bring you in .
yeah . she is aware of that , and she doesn 't care . you know , money really isn 't a big deal to her .
i 'll see you when i get back . well , it 's only been 30 minutes .
i mean , you 'd still be stuck with that face . have you checked the whole school ?
dad , i have to go back to the house to get my favorite je@@ ans@@ -- i left them . i suppose it would kill you to wear one of the other 43 pairs of jeans that i bought you .
my dad has tapes of us in the hallway that night . he knows it was you .
i dropped a ball . but i can 't say that on tv . no one will ever pay you to perform , ever .

it 's not your turn darling i 've been waiting forever , k@@ um
this is bauer . okay , i 've got vo@@ ss@@ ler .
thanks . if you 're watching this , i 'm guessing you 're pretty messed up about what happened .
all in good time . so which one is it going to be ?
no , it looks like you . this is your avatar now , jake .
i hate you . i never want to see you again .
no , ' cause i was ... actually , my part , the one of mrs. hi@@ gg@@ ins , is much more interesting than eli@@ za 's in many ways .
the president 's going to sign that treaty within 30 minutes . i 'll go as fast as i can .
does that mean he 's running point , instead of you ? it just means he wants to see the plan , chloe .
oh , disgusting . i mean , it 's not that bad , it 's just odd .
because he didn 't think it would ever happen , but he used to be like my best friend . he 's not a bad person .
welcome back to the o@@ ma@@ ha audi@@ tions . 2008 american idol , o@@ ma@@ ha !
good ! yeah , we 're gonna take this nice and easy , jake .
we are not prepared for this ! -- we have dealt with sub-@@ security before ! we 'll be more careful and we 're gonna be fine !
where you going , jack ? audrey 's given us a significant lead . we need to follow it up .
just don 't know how i 'm gonna do it . how we 're gonna do it .
i will get into acting as well . i will get into modeling .
i mean , haven 't you noticed she 's been acting a little down lately ? what am i saying ? of course you haven 't .
what is a lin@@ gon@@ berry ? uh , what is a lin@@ gon@@ berry ? correct ! " it 's the berries " , for 800 .

you make some very valid points . look , i 'll take care of it . i 'll talk to ol@@ lie later and we 'll see what he thinks .
we have it on satellite . bring him to us .
who am i talking to ? it 's larry mo@@ ss . what 's going on ?
it still doesn 't make sense to me . what ? jack bauer has been on the right side .
what 's the matter with it ? when we sent the film to tokyo to print ...
that 's the only reason . it 's what pays for the whole party . it 's what pays for your science .
i hope george has been food shopping . i 'm fam@@ i@@ shed .
but it doesn 't change the fact that she is dangerous . and if ber@@ tin@@ el@@ li retali@@ ates against the tri@@ ad or is perceived to , the tri@@ ad is gonna rain down hell and innocent people are gonna be killed .
i came like this . this you . --@@ yeah , yea@@ h@@ - -i turn . i feel the wind . i turn very strong . --@@ look , yeah , see , i ban@@ ked so hard ... the tree of souls it 's their most sacred place
that liam 's a psycho@@ path and an awesome kis@@ ser ? i was talking about silver 's movie , but wow . - wow what ?
well , unless ha@@ bi@@ b 's going to give us something more useful than that , we still have no location for these bombs . we have to try something more dra@@ stic .
ooh ... ooh , wow . - what do you think ? do you love them ?
liam is one of those . jeffrey sar@@ ko@@ ssi@@ an . this is my wife , colle@@ en .
i 've been trying to reach you . i was , uh , checking on al@@ mei@@ da .
i heard they were friends . do you think he 'll say yes ? you think he won 't ? listen , who am i ?
never mind . liam , what 's your problem ?
i need to have another chat with my mom . i 'll need the uni@@ da@@ c merger fin@@ alized by the end of the week .
well , then you don 't know your mother very well , do you ? cause believe it or not , liam ,
to give the photograph@@ ers a really good shot . now it 's time to look at some of the photo shoots that you all have shot
you know what stopped me ? fear ... of what my family would say . but ...
so glad you could make it . it 's so great to see you . you look amazing .
4@@ 99 . this orientation doesn 't count . tell me how this is not cruel and unusual punishment .
which means i have to show it to him in just the right way . so , until the treaty is signed ,
i give you my permission to speak to my father . sen@@ ora .
let 's catch some bank robbers . see that guy right there ? he 's got a temper .
did that ever occur to you ? you better make up your mind , laura .
i hate you . i have both of you !
so i guess annie really didn 't want a big , fancy proposal . i almost rented a horse .
you can stop just up ahead . no need to escort me inside .
anything else ? that 's all for now .
i was broke , and i hadn 't had a hit in like a week , and i ... i thought i was losing my mind , and i knew that charlie kept a lot of cash in his house , so i gave ... i gave liam the alarm code .
we have to talk , jim , about , uh ... john cooper . he 's doing life for killing derek bell . you remember .
hey . - hey . hey , buddy .
good . and , uh , it 's not a big deal , but just so that everyone 's clear on the chain of command ,
give it back . it was on the floor . i didn 't know it was a state secret .
i 'm not " letting " her do anything , okay ? i only just found out about it because she accidentally slipped up on one of her many lies .
off campus ? the farther the better .
you scored the ga@@ me-@@ winning goal . say something . mom ? dad ?
where 's your friend ? just the two of us tonight .
just find out what the blue monkeys want . you know , i mean , we try to give them medicine , education , roads .

he 's stopping . cross-@@ refer@@ encing with the street grid .
so , what is this idea that you need to plant ? we need the heir of a major corporation to dis@@ solve his father 's empire .
i was pretty explicit about this , tab@@ i@@ tha . i said , no car , and i meant no car .
this tree of souls place . yeah , i got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight , which it will . yeah .
no , she didn 't . i guess it 's the drugs .
hey , how you doing ? thank you .
in your father 's office , below the book@@ shelves is his personal safe . we need the combination . i don 't know any safe .
ch@@ p just fla@@ gged him on a traffic camera heading south on the 40@@ 5 . which means he may be in the l.@@ a. area .
oh . - i 'm sorry . oh . sorry .

why are you wearing swea@@ t@@ pants ? are you okay ? yeah . well , since i 'm not going to c@@ u ,

i trusted him . when ? when he promised you half his share ?
no , no , i 'm fine , i 'm fine . i 'm so sorry . no , no , it doesn 't matter , just as long as you 're okay .
hi , uh , it 's me . i mean , it 's annie .
i am learning that who i am is not so bad . yeah , well , we 're all doing some learning here today , aren 't we , sir ?
but lying to me , using me ... it 's going to take longer . are you all right ?
one of our own 's been shot . tell them to find themselves a pair of scissors .
na@@ vid , you and ade , you aren 't together exactly .
and telling me how sorry they are for my loss , which ... what does that mean anyway , my loss ?
lt 's from my father . he passed away ? -yes .

there 's an ab@@ original hor@@ de out there ma@@ ssing for an attack now , these or@@ bit@@ ali@@ mag@@ es tell me that the hosti@@ les ' numbers have gone from a few hundred to well over 2 , 000 in one day
between the summit and the hostage situation , he 's not in the frame of mind to deal with this . besides , he thinks i 'm unstable .
that would be my paren@@ tal privilege . or , you know , you could just buy me a convertible and then we could avoid this .
and i say@@ --i say that because for the first time today , i think i can see this guy making the finals . that 's good . me too .
hello . it 's ro@@ sa .
choice of 2006 hello , this is the 9 o 'clock news .
and it 's an honor to have you on the show . thank you , thank you .
i think i 'm unusual as a girl wanting to do this , but i really like to do this .
how can it not matter to you where that train will take you ? co@@ bb : because you 'll be together .
he really is too generous . we decided to give our marriage another go .
what is this ? this is what we talked about .
not stick to the original ? not stick to the exquisite words of mr. george bernard shaw ?
we 'll soon find out . take him out of here .
he says he 'll fix it . he can 't fix it .
you 've just got to face your fears . don 't think about who 's watching ...
a complete stranger that i invited to naomi 's party . what ? - it was weird .
well , i figured maybe you want to blow off some steam , get away from the paren@@ tal units for a night ? what you have in mind ?
it 's from liverpool , from the editor of the mercury . read it out loud .
how 's the play ? it 's good .
he always wants his kids to do , you know , good in life , ' cause , you know , his life wasn 't always the best . me and him haven 't always got along .
so why come to me ? it 's a pretty tight circle that knows about you and my daughter working together .
i need someone to check in this cup . thank you so much for having me here , and i will see you guys in hollywood .
so she was telling the truth . despite her claims , the majority of the people killed were members of a radical sect led by her husband .
thank you . you really are .
co@@ bb : if i get on this plane and you don 't honor our agreement when we land , i go to jail for the rest of my life . complete the job in route i make one phone call from the plane you have no trouble getting through immigration .
the acts are bur@@ sting to tell the nation new york 's got talent .
and ? i 'll take care of it . that 's it ? - and you can go now .
well , what do you know ? little old sea@@ ton bought us some time .
just keep sight of him . have you heard from rene@@ e ?
muscles everywhere , even in his ears . hmm . sounds like a pretty good-@@ looking dude .
sir , as chief of staff , i 'm here to inform you and also to protect you . those jobs don 't always work in combination .
no , i don 't want any water , and i don 't want to be locked in here with you . i want you out of our lives .
that 's why you hired me . no military action is purely surgical .
and then i can start looking for a place for you and me to live nearby . really ?
naomi , it 's a good idea . yeah , you 're struggling with this .
i 'm gonna get right to the point , jack . we 've confirmed that mar@@ got al-@@ har@@ a@@ zi has six u.s.@@ dr@@ ones under her control .
you 've got to obey the rules rule number one ...
i 'm gonna get you some help , grace i 'm a scientist , remember ?
i don 't understand . why don 't you report him ? liam , this has been a really crazy year .
12 minutes . - then the fun begins . i have a surprise for you .
he would have let us know . con@@ found that girl ! what the de@@ u@@ ce could have happened ?
yes , i did . annie , i owed you . i screwed up .
you 're a nice guy , chris . and you 've got a good personality .
ber@@ es@@ ch is transm@@ itting from the terminal . he 's got another hostage .
hey . just so you know , i didn 't sleep with your sister .
sen@@ or@@ ita es@@ co@@ la@@ sti@@ ca ? - sh@@ hh . sen@@ or@@ ita es@@ co@@ la@@ sti@@ ca , please turn apart so i can talk privately to the young lady .
the lives of those hostages depend on it . today was supposed to be the crow@@ ning achievement of my presidency .
yes , i remember . when she came back , she would not take off her le@@ i .
scott morgan doesn 't seem like the type who would try to kill himself . true , but it 's the best lie i could come up with on short notice .
i have also added contemporary songs . and i am calling it " eli@@ za rocks " !
i 'm a virgin . strip .
i 'm guessing it 'd be too much to hope your equ@@ est@@ ri@@ an bene@@ factor was , like , an elderly a@@ un@@ t-@@ type , right ? i 'm sorry .
but i don 't want nin@@ at . be@@ y@@ ral is a good hunter .
is it the teddy ? it didn 't go away , did it ?
we 'll deal with him later . agent mo@@ ss , you have my direct authorization to move on star@@ k@@ wood .
i believed that you were the one . i thought ... i thought that we were the ones .
after what you 've been through today , i 'm not going to put you at risk .
hey , hey , you 're not picking the right ones . this one tastes bad .
have you spoken to her ? none of that . none of that . this is a matter for men and it will be decided by men .
one of the president 's ai@@ des will then walk up to the po@@ dium and whisper into his ear that there 'll be no rescue , that his signature on the treaty will be the death warrant of the hostages . that will stop him , i assure you .
he didn 't answer ' cause , you know , we were arguing . and i left a message with the song on there .
i was going to say that . i just , i love them more .
i know wi@@ se-@@ ass . why did you call ? that project in your town .

a maze ? -- right , a maze . and the better the maze ...

that number increases ten@@ fold . do we have any idea where the dr@@ ones are headed ?
hundred meters and closing fast we gotta get out of here !

i was in london playing my music . london ? -it was important to me .
how do you do this every single day ? oh , it 's not easy , but it 's not always quite so high school musical .
of course . we would not miss it for the world . now let 's go get some fr@@ it@@ ters that na@@ vid 's been talking up .
what i can tell you for sure is that , by any measure edward cole lived more in his last days on earth than most people manage to wr@@ ing out of a lifetime . i know that when he died , his eyes were closed and his heart was open .

but i think that we should talk , you know ? if you 're unhappy in l. a.@@ we can leave .
yeah . so when you coming in ?
no . you 're worried about the wrong thing . it 's not your fault . the rest@@ ons aren 't the victims .
yeah , i have . and you 're sort of in the background , obviously , ' cause they 're lead .
each level re@@ lates to the part of the subject 's subconscious that we are trying to access . so i 'm making the bottom level a hospital , so fis@@ cher will bring his father .
now , we know these mountains . we fly them . you fly them . they don 't their instruments won 't work up here . missile tracking won 't work they 'll have to fire a line of sight if they bring the fight to us , then we have the home-@@ field advantage
that 's great . once more ... we 're in for some trouble .
but still , i 'm sorry , too . - thank you ... i guess .
i don 't know how much longer i 'm going to be teaching . what do you mean ?

mr. president ... tom , i said i was done talking .

i don 't think anyone would blame you , for holding back , at least temporarily , the invasion of s@@ ang@@ ala . how many people died on those planes ?
with such a strong story that can encourage so many more girls , but you 're more than that fati@@ ma .

unfortunately , my mother is moving me to another planet . new jersey .
why are you doing this ? are you blind ?
uh ... it '@@ s-@@ it 's not that simple , okay ? silver 's place is small , and ...

thank god you 're here . it is so good to see you .

thank you . she 's with mr. bu@@ chan@@ an 's people now , recovering .
consequ@@ ently , we implemented a plan intended to trick fa@@ yed into leading us to the location of the suitcase nu@@ kes . what sort of plan ?
so maybe you should just stay out of it , okay ? joseph campbell got the term " mono@@ myth " from joy@@ ce .
then why are we talking ? because i do not want you to make a mistake .
sai@@ to : it 's time . mau@@ rice fis@@ cher just died in sydney .
you know what i mean ? welcome to hollywood !

parker , there is time to salv@@ age the situation --@@ parker ... --@@ shut your pie hole ! or what , ranger rick ? you gonna shoot me ?
i 'm@@ --i 'm stun@@ ned . you were absolutely useless during that audition .
make sure the woman and child are captured before they can do us harm . thank you . thank you , mad@@ wan .
until we find a way to contain this threat , we are risking another attack on this country . and that is an option i won 't consider .
his son will soon inherit control of the corporation . i need him to decide to break up his father 's empire .
what happened here ? are you going to help us with this gear ? we 've got a lot to do .
go , go , go ! who 's next , whit@@ ney ?
leave a message . ja@@ sper , i need you to tell me where you are , okay ?
what ! - what the ... i knew that guy would do that .
i informed the white house that the rescue operation is back on track . thank you .
soon . soon isn 't good enough . -- dad ,
you 're waiting for a train . a train that 'll take you far away .
you pull out this memory . this feeling .
do you read me , ne@@ y@@ ti@@ ri do not attack !
i will split up my father 's empire . now , this is obviously an idea that robert himself would choose to reject which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious .
i 'm not gonna , i 've got the sun on my side it 's heavy , ' cause i 'm finally
mom , it 's amazing how sometimes i come to your conclusions . ella and i could use , as you say , adult supervision .
i ’ m good . - aren 't you cute . why , thank you .
boy , life is full of irony , isn 't it ? come on .
right . i was hoping to meet you at the in@@ aug@@ ural ceremony , but i heard you cancelled the ceremony .
yes , how is she ? good , she looks good .
the way i see it , we can lay around here ... ... hoping for a miracle in some bullshit science experiment ...
screw this hey ! what the hell are you doing ?
that was quite good . - thank you . yeah ... quite good .
absolutely . - well , yeah . okay .
you 've gotta stop li@@ ening to all these records now . break ' em . throw ' em away .
if that was a tooth@@ paste had that would be perfect . think about what you 're saying , right there you 're like hello ,
as you wish . bill , did you copy that ? fa@@ yed 's not going anywhere unless he talks to general ha@@ bi@@ b .
that 's correct , mr. ambassador . we 've made good on our threat .
yeah , that 's correct . so , what happened ?
conver@@ ge ? they sense the foreign nature of the dream@@ er .
now i must wait for her reply . yeah . then enjoy your pain .
she needs a bed . you can sleep in your ham@@ mock . i 'm so scared !
all right . let 's get out of here .
she would never … yet here we are . with a dilemma . they 're getting closer .
we start the second half . il@@ lyri@@ a , zero , corn@@ wall , zero . nothing but a couple of goose eggs .
no one gets out of there alive . i 'll be ready for them .
mr. kim , please sit over here . frankly , i think ceremon@@ ies are a waste of money .
i hope you don 't mind . i didn 't know if you like coffee ...
i 've been thinking , baby , maybe you were right . maybe it 's time to hang it up , retire .
this was supposed to be a covert operation . that is not the case anymore .
you feel fine doing that ? she disgu@@ sts me .
hold on a second . hey , wa@@ inf@@ le@@ et ! get it done !
that 's my point . okay , on@@ ward .
ever y@@ thing they sent me out here to do is a waste of time they 're never gonna leave home@@ tree so , since a deal can 't be made , i guess things get real simple
you did a great job . you didn 't pose at the end of the runway
so this here 's the problem . hold on . i 'll be right up .
what about the key card ? ch@@ even@@ sky had it hidden right where he said he would .
tell me . it 's silly .
so , how was your day ? uh , it was fine .
let me think ... you can run for president after i 'm gone .
tan@@ ner 's drone was hacked . mari@@ ana , get me president hel@@ ler . yes , sir .
well , oliver , you 're lonely . lon@@ eli@@ er than you want to admit . and that 's why you think you can change this girl , because you need to think you can .
this is dangerous . -- this is great . jake ? jake , listen to me . -- come on . they 're gonna put you out .
sometimes i ask the lord to take my sight away . harry caught annie making out with a boy backstage .
i am going to have a big , huge bon@@ fire , and all us are gonna throw something in it that we want to burn because we wish it never existed . too bad adri@@ anna 's still in africa .
something iike that . you really want to be an actress ? it 's tough .
one goal ... to turn my daughter into a great lady .
yeah , sounds good . hi . can i get you guys something to drink ?
i don 't want mari@@ ka to know anything about this . what do you want ?
sir . what is it ? you need to see this .

you asking me , detective ? mike , glad you could make it .

to see her vulnerable and like scared , like , ocean , my god , i might not be " america 's next top model " .
there was a pac@@ -@@ man machine in the back . i had the high score for two months .
my son started volunte@@ ering here about a year ago , and , honestly , he did it because of the community service requirement at school . at first , all my husband and i heard , over and over , was ...

thank you . oh , my god . liam .
so let 's start with anya . for me this isn 't one of anya 's strongest shot ,
they push it aside . this dream was a way of forcing you to do the right thing .
who will take care of these people if i take a break ? well , you did have a hard time caring for he people 's welfare .
it 'll be human@@ e . more or less .
thank you for flying air pand@@ ora welcome to camp --@@ so , this is my bunk . --@@ this stuff is nasty --@@ norm , go under . --@@ all right --@@ grace didn 't miss a thing , --@@ tru@@ dy , you 'll take the top one

i got movement , i got movement . hold position . something 's coming .
that i 'd been there before . been with her before .
our two final girls , anya and whit@@ ney . let 's discuss the girls on the runway .
how far away is this facility ? not far . bur@@ bank .
but , machin@@ e-@@ made tools can 't compare with tradi@@ tion@@ al-@@ made like these . lt 's not the same quality .
listen , he 's on his way here and we need to find out everything that he learned about these weapons . and i think you should be the one who de@@ brief@@ s him .
haven 't seen you a while are you okay ?
all right , this , us , it 's not a big deal . yeah , you know , we 're kind of just hanging out .
there 's an emergency door just south of gate 12 . it 's un@@ guarded .
unit one . be@@ u@@ lah . she 's the least glit@@ chy . holy shit !
yeah . yeah , over the last three hours , ge@@ dge spoke repeatedly to another secret service agent named edward vo@@ ss@@ ler .
uh , why wouldn 't i ? what do you expect ? she 's nervous .
when we get inside his mind , we 're gonna have to work with what we find . ea@@ mes : on the top level , we open up his relationship with his father and say , " i will not follow in my father 's footsteps . "
i want back on the lac@@ ro@@ sse team , mr. matthe@@ ws . my six-@@ week suspension is up . that 's true , george , but your grades are down , right , and you know the school policy .

it just means he wants to see the plan , chloe . bill , curtis just confirmed that his team will be ready in ten minutes based on jack 's new intel .
look , i swear i wasn 't . all right ?
if rex had a tan@@ trum or he was moody , she would make this amazing paper airplane . it could , like , stay in the air for five minutes .
silver still staring at me ? yeah . affir@@ mative .
you should 've come to me . but , dad ...
wait , you 're working here ? yeah .
what has karen done ? she sent in a ta@@ c team to pick them both up , but by the time they got there , o '@@ brian was gone .

see you all later , gentlemen . - see you later . mama , i 'll stay if you want me to .

that 's ever happened to me and just start all over again . i feel so new . i feel so beautiful .
something spectacular . to get their attention and earn their respect .
we can 't just ignore the law here . all these scenarios would be in violation of the po@@ sse com@@ it@@ atus act .
hey , you and silver going to the@@ each later ? i don 't know , man . she may have plans already preparing for the apo@@ cal@@ with her " the end is ni@@ gh " sign .
wow . uh , can i get a ride to school ?

already on it . all right , the chip you 'll be giving them is genuine , but it 's useless without the correct unlock code .
there 's no cure . if disper@@ sed over a populated area , the results would be catastrophic . but it goes without saying we cannot allow a private military force , these killers , to possess weapons of mass destruction .
i mean , my sister 's being photo@@ sho@@ pped into the christmas card from paris . my dad is kissing my mom while having an affair .
ber@@ es@@ ch : the rest of you will work clean@@ up on whoever makes it through that line of fire . assume ctu is in body armor , so go for the head shot .
look out . you 're right . he 's not one of ours .
i appreciate your di@@ ligence on this , but , it was a simple misunderstanding between my wife and i. everything 's been resolved . - no . see , it hasn 't .
using ? drugs ? no , i don 't think so . i 'd know , wouldn 't i ?
what 's your recommendation ? bill bu@@ chan@@ an and i agree that the greatest good would be served by allowing them to release this single cani@@ ster of sen@@ tox nerve gas .
at that point , they will over@@ run our perimeter . well , that 's not gonna happen !
we need to call the president . i just got into the mall 's internal video surveillance server .
wow , it was iike a movie . so ?
can you explain that to me ? no , i can 't explain it , cal@@ lie , nor do i have the time .
you 've just blown that . what do you think , jackson ?
once we kill them , then they 'll realize their options have run out . the only chance these people had of being rescued is gone because of me .
why are you laughing at an old man ? excuse me , which way is sh@@ inj@@ ang@@ -@@ ri ?
this is wonderful . it means the world to us .
not that jerk liam ? mom , he 's not a jerk .

arthur : in your father 's office , below the book@@ shelves is his personal safe . we need the combination . i don 't know any safe .
jamie , this is ... my roommate richard . hey , man .

we got a call from tony . he 's working with an informant inside star@@ k@@ wood .
he said it was a matter of national security . those were his exact words .
same idea mar@@ con@@ i used for his patent several years later . tes@@ la fought mar@@ con@@ i till the day he died in 19@@ 43 .

i am so not crashing and burning . hello , there . what can i get you all to drink ?
okay . everything was making sense , but now it doesn 't .
as long as he 's allowing his actions to be dict@@ ated by things only he sees or hears , it 's unlikely . very well .
tru@@ dy , fire up the ship ! go ! here .
the only person i can trust right now . if there are 17 nuclear power plants about to melt down ,

without a care in the world . and i kept thinking ...
everything . and the voice is not on point ; it 's not great .

the risk lies in ... the damage they can do if we fail . so tell me how this works .
co@@ bb : but the moment 's past . and whatever i do , i can 't change this moment .
nothing ever out of place . i 'll take that as a compliment coming from a man who pays attention to every detail .
it means that was classic right there .
and waited in hours and hours of heat for one common goal : super@@ star@@ dom . will they deliver ?
what attacked me wasn 't human . - it was tate . no , you saw that other thing , too .

i know you will . where are we ?
let 's go , all right ? come on , come on , silver .

mr. president , this is lyn@@ n mc@@ g@@ ill . you also have bill bu@@ chan@@ an ,
hey , uh , i brought you flowers . great , okay .
