there 's an outer row of columns .
we need to stimulate the market with ground@@ breaking promo@@ tional deals

college isn 't what i 'm excited about right now .
even if you 're dying of fear , even if you are sorry later , because whatever you do , you will be sorry all the rest of your life if you say no .
madame president , you don 't have another choice .
five hundred dollars , this cost . what 's inside it ?
you know , so i 'm a little bit frightened .
how do i know you can deliver ? -- you don 't .
killing the indigenous looks bad but there 's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press and that 's a bad quarterly statement . i didn 't make up the rules
eyes up . check that overhead . and watch those thermal scans .
bring me back some bean leaves .
like taylor said , give me a chance , give me a chance , give me a chance .
i need to talk to bill bu@@ chan@@ an . is he around ?

um , i have been here rehear@@ sing with brenda .
what 's going on ? why are they pulling out ?
and a beach full of classmates .
one of the cani@@ sters was bre@@ ached .
um , listen , to , uh , be clear , i 'm gonna ...

jack , this is a direct order from the president !
um , i 'll take an ar@@ no@@ ld palmer , uh , mostly iced tea . like , a quarter lemon@@ ade .
you can call , text , knock on my door at@@ :@@ in the morning .
i went public with the al@@ p@@ has situation in the first place . that 's why i am here .
which one of these people has the hidden talent ?
with what ? selling pepper ? - that 's a little too rough , lady .
uh , do you have a name ?
charles , i just need a few minutes alone with you .
and now i have to be honest and i have to tell you that it made me so mad at you for not being honest because secrets …
i didn 't sleep very well , either . i think i was probably obs@@ essing about today .
still , that 's a pretty long list .
jake ! what the hell is going on here ?
the following takes place betw@@ e@@ en@@ : 00@@ p . m. and@@ :@@ a. m.
but we can send a car with a loo@@ k-@@ alike .
the bed is happiness to me !

well . i 'm surprised you made it tonight , given your hec@@ tic schedule .
to flat@@ ter caesar , would you min@@ gle eyes with one who ties his points ?
hmm . sounds like a pretty good-@@ looking dude .
when i first heard " beverly hills , " i thought , " great .
secretary hel@@ ler and his daughter , audrey ra@@ ines , were successfully rescued .
you know , sir , if this ru@@ se isn 't working , our time might be better served getting the information out of fa@@ yed by more conventional means .
so , since a deal can 't be made , i guess things get real simple .
get one of the crew to do it .
plus , i hear it 's kind of one of those f@@ lic@@ ks you 've got to see on the big screen .
it 's not going to be a big deal .
what are you doing up here lur@@ king on your balcony ?
that 's not negoti@@ able . you want my help , we meet .
i mean , the man 's a patri@@ ot .
when somebody says you can 't have something , you try to get them fired .

did you really think you were never going to have to see adri@@ anna again ?
with all respect , we 'll need to make our own assessment .
you know , i don 't see how that lovely broker of ours is ever gonna sell that house if you keep her tied up with all your pointless busy work .
i 'm not joining the cia , but i am gonna help her , so , i 'm not going anywhere .
come up here , run up here if you can , take the golden ticket , and go to hollywood .
i got to go ! i got to go .

sir , it 's best if you hear it from her .
is curtis man@@ ning ready to send his teams in ?
what you di@@ d-- it wasn 't illegal , but .
what 's going on , brother fa@@ yed ? what happened ?
yeah , well , they also don 't attack someone just because that person used to date their girlfriend .
i wasn 't the only one who tracked it .
so you just figured you 'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man with no training of any kind , and see how it went ?
my understanding is that no one is to manipulate those ker@@ nels while the plants are on line .
" kiss the most beautiful girl in the world " ?
you got what you came for . co@@ bb : well , that 's not true .
i know jas@@ mine tri@@ as wa@@ s--@@ she 's fili@@ pin@@ o , also .

we 're falling back ! we 're getting hammer@@ ed !
ri@@ c@@ co 's not answering his wal@@ kie . check it out .
he wants me dead because i messed up with deb@@ bie .
i can 't imagine you at the end of this series , singing that as the final song .
i mean , annie 's been saying all along it wa@@ st her .
in and out over the past few months .
that 's an excuse . that 's not an explanation .
for my sake too , please think up a great scene .
out there , beyond that fence every living thing that craw@@ ls , flies or squ@@ ats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for ju@@ ju@@ bes
unlikely . he was talking to us when his transmission cut off .
we can catch ' em by surprise and lock down these weapons .
thank you for flying air pand@@ ora
and if dixon hadn 't shown up and tri@@ cked me into going to the hospital , i 'd be dead right now .
you guys are going to be in a real fashion show with other models .
if you don 't feel well , head home .

i don 't like this , not working for me .
my name is george a@@ vil@@ a . i 'm the air marshal on this flight .
well , why didn 't you just ask , pumpkin ?
which means we need to mount this assault without his help .
sorry . naomi didn 't believe that we were actually dating .
right , the 30@@ th from the end
that 's what give it its unique twist and origin@@ ality .
except for jason rich , who was playing it cool .
i was in a relationship at the time .
it 's hard to know when to get involved and when to butt
hey , annie , what do you say after school we , uh , hit up the po@@ lo lounge and you can watch me blow off david sp@@ ade for the 80@@ th time ?
the word is that i got a great guy .
it 'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father .
this isn 't gonna work . wake him up .
500 people , man . you 've never been there ?
you told him mrs. logan was in her room , when she was actually going through classified documents .
you 're walking outside together onto the stage .
our challenge is to ... try to find a way to help someone who doesn 't want it .
cheers . woo ! - cheers to that .
so shall we take a seat ? over here .

you 're psychotic . - liam , that 's enough !
he 's not much for studying , so he was double pissed .
they can up@@ load and download data . memories .
yeah , that did it right there . - i gotta tell you something .
remember , people , you lose that mask you 're unconscious in@@ seconds , you 're dead in four minutes !
my people have just informed me that the assault has been delayed .
i never thought my mother would go this far .
i mean , we had four biological sons and then her and she 's , of course , the idol to everybody in the family ,
trust me , i ... learned the hard way .
it 's that feeling of falling you get that jo@@ l@@ ts you awake .
plus it 'll help to keep you sane for the next six years .
oh , my god ! - we have a deal .
as long as she lives , she 'll never hear the name " jack bauer " .
between the summit and the hostage situation , he 's not in the frame of mind to deal with this .
you must see these si@@ dar@@ thur people ?
the environmental impact would also be catastrophic .
the boy means something to you@@ -- otherwise , you wouldn 't have given yourself up so easily .
i 'll take that as a compliment coming from a man who pays attention to every detail .
archi@@ ve room , down the hall .
is it true that the cho@@ ir@@ master 's biggest c@@ r is backup singer in a pe@@ t-@@ stain remo@@ ver commercial ? '
no , that was another guy . - bull !
my god , we even passed a law so that they could build a military base@@ miles from the nation 's capitol .

and i think that 's what anya shows so they both represent , " america 's next top model " has never had .
y@@ usu@@ f 's@@ seconds from the jump .
i am so proud of you -it 's over .
hey , sammy . it 's okay . - i want my mommy .
where would we find this amber ?
that 's their direct line to ey@@ wa , their ancestors .

they still have to climb down a little to the terrace .
i make mistake . that 's ok . are you going to let me get you out of here . yes , please .
okay , copy that . i 'll call you when i 'm ready .
he could make any sound a great mix .
all i can think of is liam .
boy really knows how to celebrate , doesn 't he ?
we suddenly felt this huge earthquake and totally freaked out and got a bunch of pots and ran and hid under the kitchen table .
we can still be together , right here in the world we built together .
you 're gonna send me back to my mom . - no , no , no .
we shouldn 't have mentioned it in the first place .
i can 't say i 'm sleeping over at your house when i 'm not .
maybe i should just stick this in the mail@@ box , make it easier for everyone .
you can 't let that stop annie from living .
he just wants me on his arm .
yes . till all the way down there .
but you did get one thing right , jackie .
you tortured my son for almost three hours and ended up yi@@ elding nothing ?
i 'm not giving up , you know .
let 's see what you 're going to do .
even if our whole town vote on him ?
here , take a sit . - all right .
we 'd be looking at massive casualties on the star@@ k@@ wood base , with no guarantee of destroying the bio@@ weapons .
i don 't know where the next olympics are at , but you might want to think about signing yourself up .
lt reminds me of my mother 's skirt . she left me , when l was boy .
my mother , maria lauren , was one of dean martin 's gold@@ di@@ ggers .
my mom made me take like six this morning just in case i got hungry during the test , you know ?
no , i couldn 't think of anything i wanted to be stuck with permanently .
american idol , it 's about giving people , you know , a second chance at their dreams .
they 're not with me , i swear . cooper ! tell me where my son is .
it 's gonna take a little time .
oh , my god , we 've been kidnapped . where were they holding you ?
okay , now , this@@ -- fi@@ rec@@ rack@@ ers and fi@@ est@@ a string ?
i gotta talk to you . - don 't . don 't .
and he wanted to know what i was feeling .
you know what ? you 're selfish , too . and ...
uh , but trust me , it 's gonna be different this year .
that shouldn 't be hard for you
your poor body , and your sad soul .
will you shut up ! i 'm trying to tell him where christ@@ y is !
perhaps you will not want to see .
everyone that sings country does this half-@@ yo@@ del all the time through almost every phrase , because they think that it brings sincer@@ ity to the lyri@@ c or some passion .
co@@ bb : then i start to panic .
i was editing a report on a student art pro@@ di@@ gy .
then why 'd you do it in here ? why didn 't you just go outside ?
one of the greatest trade@@ marks i had as lady morgue was the laugh .

and i know sa@@ sha 's going through it , too .
this is almost where your mouth kind of works ,
sir ... i think we have a problem . - what is it ?
he 's gonna take the credit when you 're the one who figured out what was going on .
yeah , stick with the op@@ rah route .
that 's when my parents got divorced .
then i take my leave then .
well , keep going . he 'll move these people have to learn that we don 't stop . come on , go , go , go
on continental accent 's big win today .
the lives of those hostages depend on it .
we have to assume he 's been captured or killed .
naomi , you 're in my house now ; you 'll do as i say .
so many things going through my mind .
re@@ deploy your men according to the original assault plan and do not contact jack .
no , come on , confidence . - okay , i think i can win this competition .
madam president , i 'm afraid i have no choice but to resign as your chief of staff .
ladies and gentlemen , i hate to say " i told you so , " but i just …
you guys have gotten very far ,
we need to evacuate the mall , now .
first ryan dra@@ ined my gas tank , and then i missed my train .
in fact , i recently bought ivy a little gift myself .

and the song that i ’ m gonna be singing that i made especially for this audition ...
they convinced gabe to let me in .
keep the pressure on , grace . -- trauma kit 's forward , on the bul@@ k@@ head .
how could he be trained ? fis@@ cher 's had an extrac@@ tor teach his subconscious to defend itself , so his subconscious is milit@@ ari@@ zed .
it would really mean a lot to be me to be able to give my daughter more than i had and more than i can give her now .
good . ' cause that 's where we 're going
and you know what i 'm a good model .
mm , how about a little discretion , ethan ?
cause liam told us who it was .
silver ! - let go of me !
roger that , stay on heading 0@@ 30

be your own boss , go self-@@ employed
yeah , cooper 's still locked up . what 's going on ?
okay , fin@@ e.@@ maybe that '@@ sor@@ mal , but the rest of it is not .
no , thank you , ev@@ el@@ yn . i 'm fine .

i always meant to go back but@@ years goes by pretty fast .
freshman year , i will guarantee my study , no matter how complicated the subject .
it seems like everybody is feeling the love .
the old-fashioned way : we go play detective .
on a@@ , the pilot 's up top the first-@@ class cabin 's in the nose , so no one would walk through .
it 's good to meet you , naomi .
but greg@@ ory bought them for me .
you risk taylor going into shock .
now , i 've already started mobili@@ zing for a ta@@ e@@ ted raid .
why did you have to say something to oliver about the job ?
we have dealt with sub-@@ security before !
and i 'm not ready . and i don 't know when or if i ever will be .
what do you want ? -a job .
and i have let down so many people over the years i 've lost count .
i don 't have all goddamn night
i haven 't seen anyone as good as him yet . so far .
they 're a first strike weapon , used to take out air def@@ enses .
and if you think that you can buy me back with a car ...
i need to know what the under@@ taking is .
you should call before you … -@@ how did you … ?
i mean , i try to help them as much as i can , but sometimes i have to remind myself it 's okay for these kids to make mistakes .
no , no , no , you stay . i 'm gonna go .
name the five presidents whose last names begin with the letter h .
those marines are gonna come through that door , and they 're gonna kill you .
but you can 't keep bringing it up every time something goes wrong . - i know .

my family stole from this city .
and that 's got to be frustrating .
you know , i actually , i have a question about this layout .
you know he 's gonna commit that bomber straight to the tree of souls
we 're being aud@@ ited by the tax authorities .
okay , not to gossip or anything , but have you heard what adri@@ anna calls na@@ vid ?
i just think i was a little naive when i started here .
how can you talk like that ? that is so mach@@ o . chief .
i mean i only got like $@@ or whatever , so if you need money .
day two , downtown los angeles for the audi@@ tions .
they 're doing everything they can , mr. president .
audrey 's given us a significant lead . we need to follow it up .
take a look under the hood .
the massive chicken slaughter is near its completion
he was a model of physical perfection .
this entire country will know what we look like in the next few hours .
he 's worked directly with hen@@ derson . that 's it .
dear , take care until you come back home .
dad , i 'm really late , and ms. wal@@ sh is going to kill me , and i 'm all kinds of nerves , and the more i talk ...
this is the first warrior dream@@ walker we have seen .
the judges are looking for the best talent in america ,
and when a kid bu@@ sts her ass to write a paper for a class she 's not even in , what kind of teacher doesn 't read it ?
you sure you 're not being followed ?
the marsh@@ mal@@ low seller left and then it got dark .
so victoria is through to vegas week and one step closer to becoming the best new act in america .
hi . i 'm brenda wal@@ sh , the play 's director .
val@@ ky@@ rie 1-@@ 6 , you are cleared and hot
we could wind up in the ...
look at them . look at the monitors !
i didn 't ask what your dad said , i asked what na@@ vid said .
i know you 're with ethan , and i 'm cool with it .
we both agreed a nuclear strike is pointless , fa@@ yed 's actions are not state-@@ sponsored and his country cannot be held accountable for this .
i 'm actually gonna go work now .
how many ? ! - ab@@ out@@ , ma 'am .
that 's something that happened to you ,
are we gonna stick around with these things on the way ?
this would have been a big hand originally .
it 's larry mo@@ ss . what 's going on ?
the united states government does not negotiate with terrori@@ st@@ s-- you know that .
simon , what do you think of el@@ sie ?
and sli@@ cing fa@@ jit@@ as and stew beef and just working with all that meat .
you warned me that if she was lying would be to cover up her involvement in something dangerous .
。 equally cute fish . - yeah , well , thanks .
now , there 's a si@@ z@@ eable check in this envelope ...
whatever i did , i am sorry
you 've got the looks , you 're really tall , you shouldn 't be in a small town like this .
gonna have you on a shuttle tonight .
mr. bu@@ chan@@ an , it 's jack bauer on line one .
for a minute , he had me wondering if you were making this whole thing up .
i feel bu@@ mmed out that i didn 't get the lead , and then i feel bu@@ mmed out that i 'm the kind of person that gets bu@@ mmed out that they didn 't get the lead , and then imagining being at that party tonight and having to pretend like i 'm not bu@@ mmed out ...
but stupid ! ignorant like a child
he said if i wanted back on the bla@@ ze ,
i ... this opportunity , it means the world to me .
see what comes of breaking the rules ?
your reproductive system ... men your age are usually weak down there
i have the nose of a tru@@ ffle pig .
sir , they 're bringing mr. bauer now .
and both trying out for american idol .
where 's the ambassador now ? -@@ he arrived a few minutes ago .
is it any wonder that i couldn 't face reality ?
you 're always doing this , " wo@@ e is me " crap and how you have no friends , and i 'm sitting here right in front of you !
we had plans . - plans for what ?
and he 'll come back to you , not as charles ra@@ ini@@ er , but as ...
but i can 't trust you anymore .
all he cares about is that beh@@ roo@@ z is sil@@ enced .
oh , see now , that 's your first mistake .
either he finds the people responsible for planning the override , or we 're looking at a nuclear holo@@ ca@@ ust .
but these are our children , deb@@ bie 's and mine and , mom , if you can 't accept that , we will move out from under your ro be@@ ep .
i think that whit@@ ney is the one that a man would want to have in his bedroom and anya would be the one you 'd buy the dress fr@@ fer@@ j@@ ts
come on . - dude , he doesn 't want to talk about it , all right ? leave him alone .
don 't give me that . just do it .
no camera but i want you to act as if it were ii@@ ve .
no . you stay on the phone with me .
well , if i 'm like a child , then ...
who guides fis@@ cher in ? not me .
max , stay here . i need someone on the inside i can trust
i don 't think anyone would blame you , for holding back , at least temporarily , the invasion of s@@ ang@@ ala .
and i broke in and i planted an idea .
would rick even consider leaving the private sector ?
i 'm not okay with you having a son and i 'm not okay that you kept him a secret from us .
i know this is hard , not now , but it 's imperative that we start to ... uncle peter .
don 't back@@ talk back to me , okay ? do as i tell you .
i 'm gonna stay there until mom comes home .
i keep hoping someone will come back in and read them .
you torture me and now you want me to forgive you ?
you say our wor@@ st-@@ case scenario gives us approximately three hours .
think about what i said , young man .
oliver , are you running to help her ... or away from the truth about your mother ?

nothing is down there , except for what might have been left behind by anyone sharing the dream who 's been trapped there before .
right . -- you can 't build because if you know the maze , then she knows it .

we 've got six hosti@@ les wearing explosive v@@ ests .
we will do a business report for you
the deal i made with er@@ w@@ ich was to sell him the chip , not to get my face all over the news .
after everything i 've been through with my mother , here i am just like her !
i 'm going to do a song that 's called " the phil .
i think what he 's trying to say is that the , uh , the house has been sold .
that she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home we had to kill ourselves .
but this woman must also choose me .
live your own constructive and meaningful life
i was a st@@ one-@@ cold aerial hunter . death from above .
10 :@@ .@@ industrial road in san ber@@ nar@@ din@@ o .
you 'll never get away with this . you must know that .
the man you saw when you were being held cap@@ tive , right now , he 's our only lead .
yeah , well , jason was big and sweet and kansas .
i do believe that a winner could come from l. a.@@ this year .
it 's not going to be the same .
i know , i ... - sweetheart , we gave him a shot .
we needed to focus on the achieved objective , which was killing her husband .
captain , this is a matter of national security .
yeah , of course i know where le@@ ila is .

jake ! jake ! excuse me --@@ watch it ! --@@ sorry !
not soon , right now@@ -- this is very important .
awesome , except you know i 'm going the party at the roosevelt .
we don 't have time for this . did he add anything ?
they killed syl@@ wan@@ in in the door@@ way right in front of ne@@ y@@ ti@@ ri .
and this book , your mother 's , has the same list of names .
just try to remember your blocking cu@@ es , ' cause a couple of times you stepped right in front of me .
what ta@@ unt ? the will , robert . that will ?
what the hell are you doing with this stuff ?
no , they hear each dinner that you attended was monitored by a private comp@@ any@@ - fel@@ sted security . - i just got off the phone with them .
and i was told by the ambassador 's staff that more will be forth@@ coming -and will be rela@@ yed con@@ currently to ctu . -@@ good .

if i were to do this , if i even could do it i 'd need a guarantee .
have you gotten anything from fa@@ yed ?
i 've been thinking , baby , maybe you were right .
he killed him@@ self-@@ we found him in the baggage room .
mo '@@ at ! no ! --@@ if you are one of us help us
yes . as it turns out , your kidna@@ pp@@ in was just a cover for a much larger attack . the terrorists used the broadcast of the trial to over@@ load the internet , and diver@@ ted all of our attention away from what they were really trying to do .
does this lock ? - oh , yeah .
tru@@ dy , fire up the ship ! go !
you sure we 're cleared for this ?
everything that he did , he did to preserve his cover .
thanks . okay , jack , i 'm putting you on with the pilot .
he has no business sticking his nose in my department .
i knew he would pay me back !
enjoy your evening , gentlemen , as i consider your proposal .
ms. silver , i am transferring you out of this class .

i came like this . this you . -- yeah , yeah .
yes , i need you to patch me through to the pilot of diplomatic flight five-@@ two-@@ zero out of van nu@@ ys .

which brings me to my point . tes@@ si@@ o-@@ san ...
mi@@ sty eyes are never meant to see clearly ...
dear naomi , i know you don 't want to talk to me , " but i hate that i hurt you .
when it is . - why don 't you both join us ?
i love you , don 't shoot till you see the whites of their eyes come , children , give me your mu@@ s@@ kets to c@@ l it says , " now come , children , give grandmother your mu@@ s@@ kets to clear
you got three months . that 's when the ' do@@ zers get there

our great mother does not take sides , jake

excuse me , pardon me , paula . - you disgusting little pig .
have to answer questions until i actually start getting fat .
i-i just need to ... to see her .
i 'm so close to you , yet i@@ -- s@@ ss !
you want to hide that we 're seeing each other . look , i want us to be you and me , but i think if we act like we 're just you and for a little while , it 'll make things easier with naomi , and that 'll give her time to hook up with some other guy and she 'll forget all about us .
look , dixon , i just gotta say it kinda feels like you were blowing me off last night .
a more realistic , appro@@ ac@@ hable , plans that can un@@ fold right now . is that so hard to think of ?
mr. bauer , what is ctu 's assault plan ?
i 'll have chloe send it to your laptop .

i just , i love them more .
her number one hits include the x@@ an@@ ad@@ u an@@ them , magic .
my mom and dad adopted me from china when i was ab@@ out@@ months old and i came to america ,

so i formed a small group to locate and neutr@@ alize du@@ ba@@ ku .
agent mo@@ ss , the president 's here . go ahead .
that 's rac@@ hel@@ . youngest of the three .
thousands of people are still lining up to register .
maybe she 's trying to kill us both . you ever think of that ?
it 's part of what they have to suffer for their art .
but the one thing i don 't want you to do is blame yourself .
tell me do the children miss me ?
hmm . could they hold a pe@@ tu@@ lant catholic school girl
and no matter what i do , no matter how hopeless i am no matter how confused , that guilt is always there remin@@ ding me of the truth .
did ty do something to you ?
how many more accidents have to happen before you 're done getting back at your father ?
we 'll call you if we hear any news .
so my weekend was pretty awesome , too .
what is it , ethan , what 's wrong ?
jack , we have the president on the line .
you 're a guy . - yeah . yeah , um ...
but , uh , just ' cause we 're not going together doesn 't mean that we can 't dance together at the dance .
van@@ ch will stay free to ro@@ am the streets .
and since your genome is identical to his , you could step into his shoes , so to speak .
i don 't care how you do it . i don 't care what it takes .
i 'm starving ! should we look at the menu ?
no , i just expected my dry cleaning , that 's all .
are you saying you would like to dance with me ?
there 's a mobile link up at sit@@ e@@ we can work out of , way up in the mountains .

he sold you out . thought to come to me and bargain for his life .
the thing is , she already did change .
we need to tell the kids about your birth son sooner than later , harry .
i stood by her for three years , and i brought her back .
you know what ? screw you , dixon !
there 's no better place to experience nature un@@ disturbed by humans .
detective , - he 's on the phone . -- who ?
if necessary , we 'll fall back on visual confirmation , but since we 're tal@@ king@@ ,@@ cu@@ bic miles ...
but if the whole matter 's gonna be treated as a joke ...
i 'm just gonna kill her , man ; this is bullshit !
that was our bust . that is our money .
i figure it 's like fi@@ el@@ d-@@ stri@@ pping a weapon . just repeti@@ tion , repeti@@ tion .
gonna have you on a shuttle tonight
maybe not . can you pull over and get this ?
and according to you , i can 't trust any of my law enforcement agencies .

i 'm drawing in on the hood investigation .
this is all about protecting the town .
oliver , this is my daughter , hel@@ ena .
well , that and my mom sold the house , - yeah . - and moved to switzerland .
i think he was counting down days till he could go back to hanging out with his friends after school , instead of man@@ ning the phones here .
they got divorced about five years ago so it wasn 't like he had to hang out with me .
i 'll check it out . - alright .
i 'll pass with not receiving the tri@@ f@@ le presents .
we lost track of each other and ...
what is going on with this show ?
it 's about listening to a photographer or director 's vision and delivering that message .
the americans have been playing us .
then you 'll be responsible for everything that happens .
i don 't know what you want ...
isn 't that the whole point of your little puppet show ?
mr. secretary , i can have a room prepared for yo to rest , if you like .
we 've just received a video feed confir@@ ming that another hostage has been executed inside the main terminal at ontario airport .
and , uh , oh yeah , this is going to be awesome right here .
hell , no . i mean , i love me some barack obama , but in this case , change is bad .
i 'm asking you to take a leap of faith . no , honey .

it was insi@@ ghtful , well structured , beautifully written .
my mom saw your mother in the supermarket wearing dirty over@@ al@@ ls with cho@@ p@@ sticks in her hair and arguing with the butcher .

jack , i know what you 've done today , the sacrifice you 've made .
dixon , you 're , like , a million miles away right now . i don 't know ... i just thought you 'd be a little bit more excited to go out , since ...
you may tell her what to do .
can you explain that to me ? because i just don 't get it .
and this photo represents the girl that is a fin@@ alist .
apparently , gabe has over@@ taken the command room .
but i also know how cute you look when you 're angry .
it 's a good thing you sealed off the cani@@ ster , mr. bauer .
team b , take the front entrance off the street .
i told him it was brow@@ ning 's so he 'd be a part of our team .
and that 's why i 'm not going to tell anyone .
i owe you a large beer , my friend . -- y-@@ you owe me a ring .
uh , er@@ in here bought herself a ticket to kansas .
oh , my god . naomi 's wearing swea@@ ts ? - yeah .

so , thanks , everyone , for coming down .
what ? - what , you thought that was an accident ?
just be back before the kick . go to sleep , mr. ea@@ mes .

ctu , we just lost video and audio .
i 'm sorry . no , i don 't , either . i just ... - um ... no , no , no , it wasn 't ...
maybe it 's a mistake to write down jack 's new information .
make sure your men don 't hit me when they come in .
watching a movie . some crap thing ...
you 're spying on her ? ! - just doing my due di@@ ligence , oliver .
and it doesn 't have to be me but then you have to show arthur what i just saw .

you know , pre-@@ show jit@@ ters , i think .
the tally 's seven to six in favor of in@@ vo@@ king the 25@@ th amendment and removing president palmer from power .

as soon as the music ends , you blow up the hospital and we all ride the kick back up the layers .
jan@@ a 's husband stan is a police officer , who happened to have been making a deposit at star@@ ling trust bank .

ryan , what 's going on out there , man ?

give me your phone . - hay@@ den , no .
hel@@ ena , it was very nice to meet you .
and i 'm not willing to take them with you .
not me . -- annie was my assistant .
maybe because you called her the sequ@@ el .
you know where you hope this train will take you but you don 't know for sure .
apparently , he 's going to go pro in a year .
why do you want to be rich ?
it 's a different lack of confidence from anya ,
those trees were sacred to the o@@ mati@@ ca@@ ya - in a way you can 't imagine . -- you know what ?
look , jack , i read your file .
in order to develop the region , - building a casino or a golf course ...
next that will happen , they 'll subpoena your bank records , and you spend the rest of your life in prison like cooper .
what do they think i 'm going to do ? kill myself ?
and she kind of sat me down and said , " i 'm not gonna lie to you .
fbi ? i 'll need to get authorization from my superior .
you think i 'm gonna fall for that ?
you didn 't watch the person you love burn to death .

i mean , aren 't you supposed to be like roger feder@@ er or something ?
so , it 's no new york pizza , but it 's pretty good for l. a.
but after what happened there weren 't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill .
mal , goddamn it , don 't do this !

to be part of " america 's next top model " .
i thought we were trying to work things out .
sir , i was pat@@ ched through to you by a ctu sub-@@ channel .

given the size of the compound , it would take a considerable force to locate these weapons .
you know , it was , it was really cool of you to still care enough about naomi to help her .
i 'd like you to meet mr. co@@ bb .
and should it happen again , i 'll have you suspended .
you 've taken on a lot for a young man
and then i remembered everything that happened between us .
they sang , they danced , and they tou@@ red with stars , basically .

mo@@ to@@ bo told me the people he 's bringing in

dawg , you sing so through your nose , man . it 's funny .
they 're trying to separate what was left of the@@ cops in the trunk …
when that deadline comes around in three hours and she starts bombing civilians , she 's going to be able to blame it on me .
i really wanted to be here tonight so that i could tell my mother , once and for all , to stay away from me .
it 's very nice to meet you -you too .
in the spirit of , like , the spanish .
why do they do it ? tell him , mr. co@@ bb .
and i ended up going to this woman 's clinic that my hair@@ dresser was talking about .

she sent in a ta@@ c team to pick them both up , but by the time they got there , o '@@ brian was gone .
and i know who did it
by now , they know we failed . it 's time we disappear .
just one vote depends on ... - so you 're buying drinks , right ?
um , most of the people i hate hang out there , so ...
it 's nice to see you happy again .

the boy who was kidnapped ? you find him ?
he 's the friend i 'm seeing tonight .
ea@@ mes ? no , he 's in mo@@ mb@@ as@@ a . it 's co@@ bo@@ l 's back yard .
it 's been an emotional day for many acts .
since when does it matter if her body 's moving like that ?
the co@@ pilot , don fag@@ an@@ son , didn 't check in when he boar@@ ded fli@@ ght@@ .

i joined the industry at@@ ...
one of my men will meet you .
what ? what do you mean , silver broke into your apartment ?
please ? you know you 're , like , my favorite teacher , right ?
i 'm kind of thinking about this whole j@@ en thing .
she had a really bad migra@@ ine .
hel@@ ena , easy . easy . you were lucky .
for sarah dying , for your drinking ?
i guess they thought i could protect them .
truth is , talking about it is not going to help .
arthur : that 's why the military developed dream sharing .
i 'm going to sel@@ fridge . -- no , grace , - i don 't think that 's a good idea . -- no , man , this is such bullshit !

some port lost in the jungle where ...
ooh , i didn 't want to do it .
how you can just quit ... quit fighting .
you know , you 've only ever been really nice to me .
so , tell me something about her . she got a name ?
until that nut comes out , come on
why not ? -- building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what 's real and what is a dream .
it 'd be weird if i was going with him .
oh , you 're the best ro@@ a@@ die ever .
tony , i got to call the white house . stand by .
i look upon my new town as an empty stage to which i 'm allowed to bring my own script .
i told mom a million times how important that is to me .
i didn 't want to tell naomi what happened between us because i didn 't want to hurt her even more .
where are you going ? -@@ to dan@@ chun@@ -@@ go@@ l near sh@@ inj@@ ang@@ -@@ ri .
the only way that i can stop that attack from happening is from the data from your flight key .
the power to blast those la@@ shes ,
he 's appeared to do the right thing , but right now , he 's backed into a corner , and he 's desperate .
it 's about the fact that now i have to spend the day in study hall because you didn 't turn in a simple piece of paper .
i mean , for the sitting part .
i say yes . welcome to hollywood , baby . come on now .
he 's been working cover@@ tly with chloe o '@@ brian to aid jack bauer , a federal fugitive .
i 've always wanted to go . down under . it 's just
for all we know , they 've been buried underground or in for@@ tified facilities .
awesome . - that 's what we want to hear .
when you stake everything , be@@ % sure of victory .
i thought it was the wind up here .
good boy , come play next time
so i have one thing on him .
he was always such a foolish i@@ ad .
what was urban legend 's becoming heroic .
... as well as floating down the river
you have to ta to naomi .
ah , right , right , right ... of course . you know ...
there 's an ab@@ original hor@@ de out there ma@@ ssing for an attack .
i ambu@@ shed teddy because he was your ex .
you know , none of this is fair . - yeah .
at that point , they will over@@ run our perimeter .
now i 'm closed out of all the classes that actually offer transfer credit .
do we have any idea where the dr@@ ones are headed ?
you should give him a raise .
the only way to make sure the assault happens in time to save the hostages is to try to slow down the signing .
oh , no , no , no , mal , you listen to me , all right ?
thanks for looking out for me , but i 'm cool doing my own thing .
i used to do do a little too much ,
you 're not used to your avatar body --@@ this is dangerous , -@@ this is great --@@ jake ? jake , listen to me , --@@ come on . they 're gonna put you out
the bed means my first time ...
as a print model , you need to be gorgeous
no , those guys are not my friends , okay ?
it 's just all those people that ...
i watched chris dau@@ gh@@ try 's audition last night , to kind of try to figure out some sort of a competitive edge , maybe . just , you know , watch how people that have made it through have done it .
and you won 't see her again .
unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down , you get them to evacuate . one hour .
un@@ anim@@ ously decided to support your candi@@ d@@ acy ...
how much will this get us ?
i want to talk to bauer .
thomas , don 't let me wake up paralyzed .
man , oh , man . we ought to have a big or@@ gy .
you won 't like it if i have to make you .
actually , we ... - know , know that silver 's not in the east wing .
you okay ? you all right ? -- yeah , i 'm okay .
tracy : the digital proof is in .
it 's going to be like heart breaking ， oh ,
it had something to do with , um ...
i have a kid or i have an abortion .
call you back in five minutes .
they attack , like white blood cells fighting an infection .
i wish more than anything , but i can 't imagine you with all your complexity all your perfection , all your imper@@ f@@ ection .
your concern is du@@ ly noted , miles .
okay , kansas , " i never " is a game .
i 'm glad you had a chance to eventually finish the song .
in a ver@@ s@@ ace dress and see looked gorgeous ,
we did this now because then they 'll figure the bust already happened .
you know , i don 't think they did tai chi in colonial new england .
that 's what it says here . - yeah .
one shade the more , one ray the less ...
my lady and i have been toge@@ ther@@ years , and she came down with cancer .
jack went to may@@ er to get the evidence to prove it .
may i ask what your time@@ table is for the invasion ?
and silver , you know , she 's a big pot of mean .
cool . so you 're going to focus on the s. a.@@ t. s ?
respect that fact every second of every day .
okay , well , i 'm@@ --i 'm obviously not gonna let you win .
what i fear is ii@@ ving on without honor .
all this is your fault . they did not need to die .
i 'm , uh , here for the future zo@@ o@@ logists of america meeting .
the goal is to make it look like we 're going to hand mat@@ ob@@ o over for as long as is reasonably possible .
none of this is going to go away .
bauer gave it to me . he wasn 't able to finish up@@ loading it to o '@@ brian before the marines came in .
more like a fifth of tequila and an as@@ s-@@ kicking .
where is larry ? - i don 't know .
we need to take immediate action or a lot of people are going to die .
right . so , what happens when we die ?
so , that is signal trans@@ duction from this root to the root of the tree next to it . so , we should take a sample .
oliver , if this were anybody else , you 'd be hoo@@ ded up right now on your way to having an ar@@ row@@ -@@ side chat with them .
this whole world that you guys live in that be fine for the two of you and all of your friends with all of their benefits , but it is definitely not fine with me .
oh , it was your friends . you just went along for the ride ?
look , lights on , lights off , done .
then you go back to saint vi@@ vi@@ en , and i go back to personality theory and psycho@@ patho@@ logy .
it 's his fault , and he needs to be the one to fix it .
just happy to see you in person .
ma@@ g the all mother smile upon our first meeting
l hope the snow mel@@ ts soon .
i said we 're not developing ru@@ shes .

well , i was wondering how long it would be before you came begging me .
what about derek ? as soon as we get more information , i 'll make sure you 're told .
just , you know , do this for yourself and ...
right , you tell fox@@ that we want to see you at the final reporting for fox@@ .

hi . can i get you guys something to drink ?
i read you --@@ ne@@ y@@ ti@@ ri ! --@@ se@@ ze 's dead they are very close . they are many
what ? - you 're all that i have .
this is the best part of being in this competition .
hon , it 's me . i hope it 's going okay . i 'm sorry i 'm not there .
we do it together , or we don 't do it at all .
but i have no customer , who can i serve ?
so we 'll stop and get more gas !
di@@ er@@ k doesn 't know i have kids . - di@@ er@@ k ?

when she comes back , you 're gonna have her building ma@@ zes .
two weeks ago i was sharing a cell with nine finger nick , and now i 'm in california getting ready to go - sailing with my kid . - you should 've never been sent away in the first place . you were framed .
if you wish to survive you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude
and i hur@@ t-- i hurt her family ...
i don 't think it was worth it .
his name is derek re@@ ston . we were close before i ... went away .
did you guys just drag me here for lunch to torture me ?
and it works great here , she will write angry songs and i 'd buy it .
we don 't have exact numbers , but based on our video surveillance , our best guess is between eight and nine hundred .
and she was way over co@@ well .
i 'm honored to be able to work here , where i 've been born and bred .

mr. matthe@@ ws probably didn 't want to be hurt by what you said , but he was .
well , that 's ' cause she likes plants better than people .
no , no , i-i don 't , but if it hurts you this much to watch adri@@ anna do this to herself , then what are you gonna do if you really lose her ?
doesn 't make sense . - i know .
i can 't take it anymore i can 't keep trying to save you when you won 't even try to save yourself .

y@@ usu@@ f : the compound we 'll be using to share the dream creates a clear connection between dream@@ ers whil@@ st acceler@@ ating brain function . -- in other words , more time on each level .
i don 't actually know why we 're bothering with this conversation , eric .
that i woke up at@@ :@@ this morning , all so i could meet a trainer that my mom can 't afford ?
and truth be told , billionaire was your least attractive quality .
jake , that armor 's too thick . trust me .
what 's wrong ? it 's nothing serious . we found something that we think is yours . it should have been in the baggage compartment .
jake ! jake . wake up ! jake , please !
it 'd be a pleasure to take your money .
you haven 't been to bed . - shh !
i just didn 't figure you 'd end up with a jo@@ ck .
he 's right on the other side of the door !
there 's nowhere i 'd rather be than right here with you , right now .

co@@ bb ! co@@ bb , did we miss it ?
you know , i could use a place to stay while i 'm getting my sea legs back under me , george .
welcome to your new body , jake
dr. juven@@ al ur@@ bin@@ o ? - he 's a busy man .

so you wanted to , you know , fill us in on your little secret before the whole world knew .
where the audi@@ tions have traveled to the city that never sleeps .
jack , we just detected what might be a du@@ ress code in the conversation between general ha@@ bi@@ b and fa@@ yed .
everyone inside the building must proceed to the nearest exit as quickly and as safely as possible .
so , do you like what i 'm doing to the place ?
harry , when she 's ready to talk to you , she will . we have to trust her .
there 's too many unusual circumstances at work her@@ e-- i want to try to understand it better before we send our people in .
we will fight terror with terror .
okay , i don 't have time for this .
our data analyst has reviewed the evidence and believes it to be genuine .
which means i 'm not lying on my carpet , in my apartment .
but they don 't know the truth . --@@ - truth ? what truth ?
he wants that plane down before jack finds the evidence .
i would literally do anything for you .
ugh , i wish i could be like that .
that i 'm filing for divorce as soon as i get back to d. c.
and then i just couldn 't get out of the car .
to get into the software ker@@ nel , but the n@@ r@@ c will never let me . it 's too dangerous .
jack bauer is inside providing rec@@ on for ctu 's rescue operation .
i can do this all day . it 's kind of fun .
assuming you 're right , what are we going to do about it ?
naomi will never believe that we slept together .
it ain 't the best in l. a. no more .
the better the doctor , the need ...
actually , my mother has the connections .
do you two enjoy working together ?
it 's a lack of confidence that she has .
and his chances of survival are not so great .
it 'd be a fresh start on a new world

i would be glad to take your money in whatever form you 'd like to give it to me .

everyone will know it 's about annie .

head of the e@@ bor@@ a gang says he doesn 't know you .
when this crisis is over , tom , and those nu@@ kes are secured .
it makes you just even that much more awake , like ,
i 'll bring this to the car .
oh , it pains me even more .
so i 've been pretending to be my brother while he was in london for the past two weeks …
so far we haven 't been able to get through anyone .

and this is an example for me ,
as head of security , it is my job to keep you alive
inside the bank ,@@ men ,@@ women .

the door , tom . - excuse me , sir ? what ... ?
this idiot tried to catch the pot .
i 'm fed up with this car chase !
we weren 't sure if they came here to audition or if they just crashed our show to find a decent man .
i know that you think that , ja@@ sper .
do you people realize ? let go !
l almost cried , thinking of my mother who left me .
i thought hub five was out for a re@@ boot .
need to get the dress , need to get you in order right now .
and they have bones reinfor@@ ced with naturally occurring carbon fiber they are very hard to kill
the estimates from the mall are much lower than we originally anticipated .

we haven 't talked about it in awhile ...
can you do it ? -- are you offering me a choice ?
all right , well , ty and annie are about to have sex on stage .
when they took a wrong turn on a one-@@ way street in avi@@ gn@@ on and ran into a taxi cab .

i appreciate the gesture , but it 's gonna take a lot more than@@ cents .
you should go away . --@@ no , you 'd miss me
it 's called not being a criminal .
i 'm gonna go check the cafeteria . - cool .
say you have ro@@ sco@@ e 's in your book bag , and all is forgiven .
look at all this fresh meat !
if he also chooses you , move quick like i showed .
i can barely remember my old life .
you know , oliver , i 'm no expert at this , but ...
what ? - it 's a letter from max .
but that being said you saved yourself with the second walk .
professor chan didn 't go for a double-@@ grip
pand@@ ora will shit you out dead with zero warning
what did i tip you about earlier ? play the low cards first .
let 's bury the bad memories of him too .
i was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace .
are you sure my son won 't miss you ?
upon hearing the news , my father mounted his really cool motorcycle to buy the mother of his child and future children her favorite flowers .
i 'll show you what it 's like to be in my school .
hey , you want to go to palm spring - where ? - palm springs .
we 're going to vote now , kyle .
this should be very simple . shut up ! it won 't be .
our two final girls , anya and whit@@ ney .
so , making me have dinner with the love of your life is what , oliver ?
listen to me . you 've got one hour .
look like he 's been pretty much executed .
i promise , once you 're there , you 're gonna feel better .
oh , shoot . i forgot to tell you something .
so jason was leaving the farm for hollywood .
the top three bad@@ dest chick club , work it out .
and i can teach them to you , so that even when you 're asleep your defense is never down .
i can 't even imagine being you .
why do you do this to yourself ?
oh , this is good , we get the mom .
jake ! jake . wake up ! jake , please !
well , what 's down there that you regret ?
maybe your mother did something with it .
disen@@ gage the ci@@ p module . begin the off@@ load .
where are we going ? - to our death !
i can 't believe you got to move in so fast .
after next week , you know , i 'll cut down@@ 9@@ e on a few shifts , but ...
well , did you talk about it ?
is there anything that you can tell me that will help us catch her ?
okay . no benefits for you , then .
then we need to find out ... - no .
i can 't stay with her anymore , because she doesn 't exist .
maybe , if we could do it early .
and after that , it 's all over .
and begged her to live with me .
having a talent saved his life .
if this man 's a hero , i don 't know what my life in this city as a cop means .
that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious we lost sight of what was real .
and i can negotiate the terms of their re@@ location
and you , you are a pi ph@@ i waiting to happen .
that hood guy showing up , kyle shooting a cop .
what will become of me now ?
so , that is signal trans@@ duction from this root to the root of the tree next to it . so , we should take a sample
see the handle on the safe ?
don 't point your finger at me !
yes , yes , i 'm coming . i 'm coming .
and you know what you did ?
you and i must talk ... man to man .
i believe that you measure yourself by the people who measured themselves by you .
you 're an adult now , and it 's your decision , and no !
crime has never appe@@ aled to me as a way of life .
and each tree has ten@@ -to-@@ the-@@ fourth connections to the trees around it .
they can 't move on him without evidence of new criminal activity .
and people shouting , and the sound of ...
we need you to seal off the north end . we 're going in .
that 's what we 're here to figure out . robert 's relationship with his father is stressed , to say the least . - can we run with that ?
real heavy duty . there 's a secondary ring here and an inner ring . there 's a core structure like a spiral
as a junior , i 'm sure you 've already started thinking about where you want to go .
why would you ask na@@ vid and i on a double date just thought it 'd be fun .
he 's gonna transfer your ass to jun@@ eau so fast , your head will spin .
look , i don 't know what the story is with you and sammy 's dad .
uh , we know . we were able to trace the ip to an address . we have a team there right now .
the shor@@ test , but the biggest of them all is ...
mr. sai@@ to , we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extrac@@ tor .
what do you mean , why ? just take a look at this face .
and as chris headed off with his dad and his grandma , we barely noticed paula was missing .
she says all energy is only borrowed , and one day you have to give it back .
it 's such a dark , tragic role , and i 've never done anything like it before .
good , ' cause that 's the one you got .
i 'm sorry it 's all right , it 's cool .
... i stand before you ready to serve the o@@ mati@@ ca@@ ya people .
i 'm telling you , i spilled this gn@@ arly yogurt drink on my laptop ,
do you think about sex a lot ?
you must understand the fragile political climate of our country .
i 'm sorry but i 've got a meeting right now .
just imagine , after being granted the miracle of having my child returned to me ...
you 're forgetting something . -- i 'm sorry , michael .
that you 're both covering something up .
so , do you think you could look absolutely perfect in something that you already own ?
oh , look at him . he 's pi@@ ti@@ ful .
it involves telling the mark that he 's dreaming which involves attracting a lot of attention to us .
are you talking about , um , extraction ?
l thought you were the police . my goodness .
oh , please tell me you 're here to turn this thing off .
there are no small parts , only small actors .
no . i just thought ... it 's going to be hard , but they 're doing a whole memorial program for rex .
so i 'm going to be up all night with will shakes studying .
well , well , well , the notorious brian matthe@@ ws .
gre@@ den@@ ko betrayed us . he led ctu right to me .
i 'm just , i 'm really kind of ner@@ v .
no ... - are you gonna hit me ?
so now we 're trapped in fis@@ cher 's mind , batt@@ ling his own private army .
because you have done nothing but try to avoid me since you came back to school , so you 're not here tonight as my friend .
that was like the hung@@ arian jan@@ is j@@ op@@ lin or something .
let 's build a new town hall an eight floor hotel .
and people pay you for that .
i was just struggling not to i@@ et my nose run .
and your act is that you kick seven bells out of your dad , right ?
i 'm here to escort mrs. logan .
i 'm awake with my son . and this has been happening since the accident ?
you are part of the people .
road pa@@ vement will make here a better place .
all right , what@@ cha gonna sing , man ?
van@@ ch 's position is too heavily for@@ tified .
i 'm accepting you . i understand you . so you gotta get this , okay ?
you knew these risks and didn 't tell us ?
if you want to hit this thing , it 's gonna be complicated .
well , we 've got to find out .
look , kelly , i just want you to feel like you can talk me , you know , like you can tell me anything , and if there is something going on with you and your ex , then ...
from what i understand , miles , she got out of ctu right under your nose .
because i 'm trying my hardest and doing my best .
whoa , that is some serious wee@@ d@@ age .
how many times do i tell you there aren 't any ?
she must have been casing the house . i 'd ...
what is the mari@@ ana tren@@ ch ? - what is the mari@@ ana tren@@ ch ?
it 's your job to tell ja@@ red when the lights go up and when the lights go down .
there 's no cure . if disper@@ sed over a populated area , the results would be catastrophic .
if you guys are drinking , i don 't want to be the dow@@ ner .
mrs. logan , if someone altered the recording , of your conversation with david palmer , the president needs to know .
agent walker , are you still there ?
i was going to kill him but there was a sign from ey@@ wa
... you will teach him our way to speak and walk as we do . why me ? that 's not fair …
the general is under tight scrutiny by the government .
i 'm just going to do a job and cash a pay@@ ch@@ k .
i always thought an older brother would , you know , look out for me , kick anybody 's ass who messed with me , that sort of thing .
with the exception of the two business interests ...
and i want other women in america to feel good about themselves .
yeah . i 'm sorry , i feel a little ... strange .
but probably not as happy as you are .
you get drunk every market day
no , that 's a jump " a " , i need a load " a. " damn it , move .
i 'll be going to california university .
and i ’ m proud of you . you are my daughter .
interns get school credit . i 'm more like a cour@@ t-@@ ordered slave .
don 't you realize how many more people could die if these men don 't lead us to the other@@ cani@@ sters ?
well , i figured the entire queen family and their check@@ books should be present .
ceo ba@@ ek man-@@ ge@@ un i agree with you on that .
owing to certain company activities we need a secret book of accounts to record the money flow behind the scenes .
maybe we can even get our pictures taken together .
if you get there before i do , i want you to stand down .
shut it ! i got nothing to lose , per@@ ez .
i 'm near the metro@@ link station on la@@ ss@@ en in cha@@ ts@@ worth .
how many team members ? -- five .
ha , ha . no . i got a haircut .
i didn 't call my dad because there are some things you can 't just blur@@ t out , like " i 'm gay .
sir , my sources have informed me that ev@@ ans was a la@@ st-@@ second replacement .
so when my grandmother died , i moved to kansas to be with my mom .
swap with paula for a second .
why didn 't he go ? when i saw him at the hospital , he was all dressed up .
but there 's a strong g@@ ust , and the winds change
i managed to stop them from killing bauer .
jack , did you get the surveillance footage from hy@@ att security ?
using the ci@@ p device as bait was necessary to the undercover operation .
how are we gonna bring fis@@ cher back ?
i 'm the vigil@@ ante . you 're the cop .
that 's how it works ! okay ? -- all right . all right , gabe . i 'm sorry .
oh , and can you label four of them " silver ,
i 've never been in the same bed with any other man other than my dead husband .
none of that pow@@ dered sugar business .
and i will kill him immediately .
we 're going to hang when we get there , but we 're not actually going together .
spanish architect . - yeah , sure , right .
now ? we 're still filming . i can 't .
i , i just want you to get better , okay ?
i told my mom one day , i said , " mom ,
i 've been ... i 've been thinking about you non@@ stop .
he 's probably just giving her a ride .
was saying that he had a seizure or something .
you know , s-@@ some things happen for a reason .
right around christmas , when he ... disappeared , he gave me this .
well , my man , go right out there and get the golden ticket , baby .
she is just a pro@@ jection . fis@@ cher . fis@@ cher is real .
we don 't have one second . we 're running out of time to save the hostages .
imagine all the moments in dixon 's life that made him who he is .
jeez ... he 'll kill her if he doesn 't get to you .
well , well , well . i 'd say diplomacy has failed .
and we will show the sky people that they cannot take whatever they want , and that this , this is our land !
i 'll get you the money , man .
so you 've not reported me to anyone ?
because you 're the one-@@ - don 't do the " what " with the high tone to me .
and a heat wave in l. a.
the local stock market today twice fell bel@@ ow@@ ,@@ points
but what we do know is that at@@ :@@ p. m .
co@@ bb : what for ? -- here , i 'll show you .
we 're gonna spend a lot of time up here . hey ! how you doing ? norm , avatar driver --@@ hi . --@@ hey

why ? - i 'll leave it alone .
do not attack the sky people . many o@@ mati@@ ca@@ ya will die if you do
he could remember nothing at all of his past life .
sure . - it 's about our son .
anyway , if there 's any questions day or night , you know where to find me .
karen ha@@ yes is meeting him in the lounge . -@@ all right .
notori@@ ously late . someone 's probably throwing a fit or eating a bat or something .
and i heard you and mom talking about money problems .
the gloves and clothing that they wear , those are dis@@ posed of on a can and sealed tightly to be stored underground .
that pressure point shows a bad diges@@ tive system
that many people quit ? -no .
hollywood ! - we 're going to hollywood !
you 'd know this if you had any training whatsoever .
thought i 'd get you with the double har@@ ris@@ ons .
this source the same reason you got ia talking to may@@ he@@ w ?
you know , the will means that dad wanted me to be my own man not just to live for him .
i ’ m@@ , and i ’ m from venezuela , originally .
we don 't really want to be a couple .
well , i got news for you , dar@@ lin ' .
that means in the eyes of the law , you 're as guilty as cooper .
keeping an economically , you know , challenged teacher around prote@@ c from that pes@@ ky little label .
my father has the phone now .
what , i should go home ? what are you suggesting , i take a rest ?
even in a town this big , people don 't just disappear .
i 'm going to have to ask you to take a paid leave of absence .
but you went out with that duke or@@ sin@@ o guy , right ?
maybe you can eat some of those fancy peanuts from behind the bar .
all this time , you 've just been pretending that you wanted to have a life with me ?
she 's a real char@@ mer . - oh .
hasn 't stopped you before , now , has it ?
fa@@ yed might know that this is a setup .
oliver , i have no idea what your father was involved in or with whom .
well , the car broke down today .
i would argue it is may@@ he@@ w 's fault more than it is yours .
but he hasn 't , right ? -no , sir .
couldn 't tell them i went to your house to score coke , could i ?
i took care of the girl ! mad@@ wan knows !
you know , lyn@@ n , i 'd rather not .
i don 't want to see you hurt , so you just tell me what the fbi knows about what we 're doing here , and i can 't say you 'll walk away smiling
yeah , thank goodness , so , how did your walking go ?
and i work security for the man she 's meeting with .
now , look , i know that you 're mad at me , but we have a much bigger problem .
and you had sex with somebody else , and if you don 't tell naomi the truth , she is going to ruin my life , liam .
no matter how hard i try , i 'ii never be as good as you .
look . you call the pilot and you tell him that i don 't care if bauer is making threats or not , that plane has to land immediately .
we just ... don 't talk about stuff like that .
more of a pho@@ bia . they wig me out .
are you good enough to win this whole contest ?
you just handed her exactly what she needs to ridi@@ cu@@ le you and humili@@ ate you for the rest of your life , and me , too !
it 'll take us a few hours to get them dec@@ an@@ ted but you guys can take them out tomorrow there 's yours
they 've scrambled an f-@@ 16 to intercept , but it 's still ab@@ out@@ minutes out .
it 's a matter of time before we 're discovered .
for that matter , who gave it to you ?
and now i have absolutely nothing to bring to whatever this is .
all right ? she 's not doing drugs . i would know .
cause she thinks jack is innocent , that president logan framed bauer .
coming up , paula finally blows into town .
before l die , l want to tell you the truth .
father told me to wait and gave me@@ won to buy marsh@@ mal@@ lows .
did he find out anything more about dr. wil@@ de ?
hey , home is where the heart is , an so there 's a bli@@ zz@@ ard in kansas .
i 'ii stay right by your side .
you bought that horse with naomi 's money , didn 't you ?
this is dangerous . -- this is great .
those that can 't iove can never be io@@ ved .
it gave us our only chance to rescue the president 's husband .
and colonel du@@ ba@@ ku in an effort to undermine this nation 's foreign policy
we 've been in contact with bauer , we 've been in contact with the cia .
and you , hil@@ de@@ br@@ anda , are you in love ?
maybe you think you 're more persu@@ asive than you are , or maybe she thinks she 's fine the way she is on her mission of righteous fury .
that 's called taking the initiative , son .
i was wrong not to trust you , and i-i let my prejudice about bauer get in the way .
just in case you need muscle to get to the front of the line .
i would have no gam@@ bit to play here .
yes , a large shipment of bio@@ weapons was delivered to star@@ k@@ wood .
tracy , i want to be very clear on something .
i 'm running into a meeting with the president i 'll assume your answer is " yes .
grace ? -- well , who 'd you expect , numb@@ nuts ?
where is he ? -- dude who gave me this ?
sen@@ or@@ ita es@@ co@@ la@@ sti@@ ca , please turn apart so i can talk privately to the young lady .

annie , charge your cell next time .
it 's him ! it is the tele@@ gram boy .
i went behind her back and i started dating you , which is a really jer@@ ky thing to do . but i did it .
american idol , me and dar@@ ry@@ l will be your next .
ja@@ sper is not a drug dealer !
as it occurred to you that part of why you 're finding it difficult to help your son is because you haven 't truly accepted what he 's experiencing .
oh , thank you . thank you for coming .
follow the path between the houses to the alley , turn right and go to ven@@ tur@@ a boulevard .
that 's the only reason@@ . it 's what pays for the whole party it 's what pays for your science
parker , you know , i used to think it was benign neglect but now i see that you 're intentionally screwing me
it got back to division , who couldn 't understand why an agent who had already been transferred stat@@ e@@ side was still in the field .
i might hang this in my living room .
ade , you went there once , right ? with your mom ?
the date on this is over . this is the wrong file .
i '@@ m-@@ i 'm sorry . look , i ... i know that they were a gi@@ ft@@ and it 's all about the thought and ... it 's kind of the thought that bothers me .
